Promote actions that both reduce carbon emissions and improve health: supporting a rapid and equitable transition to a clean energy economy; ensuring that health is central to climate change mitigation policy; accelerating mitigation actions that bring the greatest health gains; and mobilizing the strength of the health community to drive policy change and build public support.', 'Some communities, including Boston, Houston, and Orlando, are seeing twice as many tidal flooding days each year as they did 20 years ago.', 'The sector accounts for 10. percent of total U.S. employment—more than 22 million jobs.', 'Since January 2022, EPA and CBP have denied entry to approximately 81 shipments of illegal HFCs..', 'Today, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a direct award of $8.8 million through President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda to Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM) and a nationwide network of partner air agencies, including in Alaska, Washington, and Idaho..', 'Film actor and activist Jane Fonda said, \"There\\'d be no climate crisis if it wasn\\'t for racism.\"', 'Currently, in approximately two-thirds of the country, E15 cannot be sold from terminals starting on May 1 and at retail stations starting on June 1..', 'Publix Super Markets – Five locations in Alabama, North Carolina, and South Carolina achieved five-year recertifications..', 'Rising water and air temperatures have already forced some nuclear plants to temporarily close to lower the risk of overheating.', 'Today we’re making $3 billion available to install cleaner and more efficient technologies while cutting air pollution to protect the people who work at and live near ports.”, , “Our country’s ports feed our supply chains to put food on our tables, keep our businesses running and provide for our everyday needs,” said Governor Roy Cooper..', 'Nearly 2.5 million energy-efficient new homes and apartments have earned ENERGY STAR certification to date, and about 10% of all US homes built in America earned the ENERGY STAR label last year..', 'It also generates over $200 billion a year in sales and makes up about 6% of the U.S. manufacturing gross domestic product.', 'Today, April 15, the US Environmental Protection Agency denied a petition to remove stationary combustion turbines from the list of sources subject to regulation for emissions of air toxics, maintaining public health protections for communities near these facilities..', 'Landfills are the third largest source of methane in the United States and EPA is tackling these sources as part of its National Enforcement and Compliance Initiative dedicated to Mitigating Climate Change..', 'Storm surge from hurricanes already threaten dozens of power plants and refineries on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts.', 'Exposure to extreme or prolonged heat can cause exhaustion, heat stroke, kidney and heart disease, and pregnancy complications.,10 In fact, extreme heat is already the leading cause of weather-related deaths in the United States.', 'Natural disasters and droughts can also lead to more tobacco and alcohol use, as well as domestic violence.,\\xa029 In addition, heat overall has been linked to increases in violence.
