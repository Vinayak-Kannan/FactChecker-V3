This process happens every 700 years to our Earth. The inner core is spinning differently then outer Earth and it actually stopped then reversed which is do to with magnetism in our core with relationship to our Sun’s magnetism. Is it the end of the World? No. It’s just the start of a new cycle of our Earth and it really explains why we have a cycle of seismic and volcanic eruptions. Also explains why we have climate change too. Could this lead to an increase in seismic and volcanic activity. Yes because our Earth’s outer part will have to catch with the inner core and this will cause faster plate movements which we are witnessing now. So no it’s not the end of the World. It’s just beginning it’s new cycle and it doesn’t mean the pole shit is imminent. This is a process and it takes time to go through that process. Our Earth is slower than most planets when it comes to rotation and certain cycles. So it’s going to be years before anything really bad happens to Earth but yes, we will see increases in things. You just have to go back to the last cycle from 1700s to 1900s to see what I’m talking about. Then go back before that and you will see the cycle. It’s all connected to our Sun. I hope this helps.
