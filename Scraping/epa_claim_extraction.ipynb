      "{'version': '2', 'sentences': 'Some communities experience disproportionate impacts because of existing vulnerabilities, historical patterns of inequity, socioeconomic disparities, and systemic environmental injustices (e.g., redlining). People who already face the greatest burdens are often the ones affected most by climate change.. EPA is committed to supporting communities—particularly those facing disproportionate impacts—develop and implement equitable solutions to climate change impacts. Only through collaboration across all communities and levels of government can the nation make progress in addressing systemic factors that impact climate equity.. Climate equity is the goal of recognizing and addressing the unequal burdens made worse by climate change, while ensuring that all people share the benefits of climate protection efforts. Achieving equity means that all people—regardless of their race, color, gender, age, sexuality, national origin, ability, or income—live in safe, healthy, fair communities.. Climate equity is a part of the overarching aim of environmental justice, which is a cornerstone of EPA’s mission. Environmental justice is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. Striving for climate equity is putting these same values into practice when tackling climate change impacts, and ensuring that everyone has equal access to resources and safe spaces.. Climate equity can be woven into the broader efforts to address the socioeconomic, sociocultural, and physical impacts of climate change. It is a public health issue in every respect. The following principles can help governments, community leaders, and community members incorporate climate equity considerations in their work:. Some communities may be part of multiple groups that are particularly vulnerable to climate change. For example, one community could have a higher percentage of pregnant women or children, which could increase their vulnerability to particulate emissions. In another example, communities with a high elderly population, which is also non-English speaking, may be more susceptible to climate impacts because their limited access to resources compounds their health risks. Those risks extend to a broader community if it is disproportionately made up of socially vulnerable populations. This is one reason why communities are not impacted proportionally.. Part of understanding climate equity is recognizing specific populations that are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts. You can learn more about the relationship between exposure, vulnerability, and human health by how they interact within communities. In addition, you can explore the impacts on certain groups in greater detail by visiting the following pages:. Learn more about environmental justice and climate equity:. Climate change impacts happen at varying scales, including globally, regionally, and locally. For example, while a region may experience drier conditions, some localities within that region may experience wetter conditions. Recognizing the scope and scale of these impacts helps us better understand the ways climate change affects us where we live.\\xa0. EPA is currently developing new content that presents the climate change impacts that regions and states are already experiencing. This suite of material will present climate impacts for all 50 U.S. states plus Washington, DC and territories, as well as broader geographic regions within the United States. Climate impacts highlighted will focus on features of individual states or territories that are iconic or culturally meaningful for that area.. While new content is under development, you may wish to explore other resources relevant to the state and regional impacts of climate change, such as the\\xa0 State Climate SummariesExit EPA’s website published by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), or the\\xa0Fifth National Climate AssessmentExit EPA’s website, which includes chapters discussing climate impacts on specific regions in the United States..

EPA works to protect and improve human health and the environment. Helping vulnerable populations adapt to and protect themselves against climate impacts is a part of that. See additional resources on related EPA adaptation efforts:. A number of climate-related hazards threaten the health of pregnant, breastfeeding, and postpartum women in the United States. Below are some examples of the potential health impacts of these hazards.. Climate change will impact water resources in many ways. For example, changes in water and air temperatures, heavier and longer rains, flooding, and rising sea levels can introduce disease-carrying organisms into drinking water supplies and recreational waters. Drinking or coming in contact with untreated contaminated water can cause gastrointestinal and other illnessesExit EPA’s website for any individual;13 however, pregnant women have a higher risk of gastrointestinal illness if they come in contact with contaminated water than other adults. Severe gastrointestinal illness can cause pregnancy loss and preterm birth.. Flooding has been associated with conditions that threaten maternal health, including anemiaExit EPA’s website (low red blood cell counts sometimes caused by low iron intake), preeclampsiaExit EPA’s website (a high blood pressure condition), and eclampsiaExit EPA’s website, which can cause seizures.. As the climate changes, rising temperatures and extreme weather events—such as floods and droughts—threaten food quality, production, transportation, availability, and safety. Food-related illnesses, such as listeria and toxoplasma, can be life-threatening and increase the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, or premature delivery.. Food safety and proper nutrition are critical to both maternal and fetal health. Extreme events, such as wildfires, floods, heat waves, and droughts, may disrupt food production and distribution, increase costs, and limit availability. These impacts could make it harder for mothers to get healthy food. Food shortages may lead to poor nutrition, which can make pregnancy more difficult and cause delivery problems, low birth weight, and even infant mortality.. Extreme heat events are expected to last longer and become more frequent and intense as the climate changes. Heat illnesses can occur when a person is exposed to high temperatures and their body cannot cool down. Increases in average and extreme temperatures are expected to lead to more heat illnesses and deaths among vulnerable people, including pregnant women.. Exposure to extreme heat can also lead to dehydration and kidney failure in pregnant women. Pregnant women are also more prone to heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Extreme heat exposure in pregnant women has been associated with low birth weight, preterm birth, and infant mortality., 25. Photo caption endnote:26. Pregnant, breastfeeding, and postpartum women may also be members of other groups with specific vulnerabilities to climate change. For instance, pregnant women from communities of color, low-income groups, and certain immigrant groups may face increased risks to certain climate impacts, less access to care, or higher incidence of chronic medical conditions when compared to other groups. These groups of people are also more likely to live in areas with higher levels of air pollution, older infrastructure, and increased risk of flooding, all of which may be worsened by climate change.. Climate change may increase outdoor air pollutants, such as dust from droughts, wildfire smoke, and ground-level ozone. Pregnant women (like other vulnerable groups) are sensitive to the harmful effects of wildfire smoke. They should take extra actions to reduce their exposure to wildfire smoke, which could affect the developing fetus and may raise the risk of low birth weight and premature birth.. Rising temperatures and changing seasonal patterns can lengthen the times when mosquitoes and ticks are most active and widen their range. In some regions, that results in a northward expansion of where ticks may live; while in other areas, ticks may be active for longer periods throughout the year. Warmer temperatures associated with climate change can also increase mosquito development and biting rates, while increased rainfall can create more breeding sites for mosquitoes.. These changes may increase the prevalence of mosquitoes that transmit viruses, such as the Zika virus and dengue fever. If a woman is infected with Zika during her pregnancy, the infection can be passed to her fetus. Infection can cause certain brain defects, including microcephalyExit EPA’s website, where a baby’s head is much smaller than expected due to lack of brain development.. In addition, pregnant women and fetuses are at more risk of developing complications from other mosquito-transmitted illnesses, like dengue fever, due to immune system changes during pregnancy. Most people who contract dengue fever experience mild symptoms such as aches and pains, nausea, and vomiting. They also recover in a few days to a week.. Trauma from extreme weather events can cause psychological stress, worsen mental illnesses, and add emotional stress for pregnant and postpartum women. One study found that compared to men, women were at increased risk for PTSD and other mental health effects after a disaster. In addition, extreme weather events can disrupt support networks, behavioral health services, and treatment access—all of which may affect women’s ability to cope.. Photo caption endnote:38. Women who are pregnant, planning a pregnancy, or who are new mothers can take steps to reduce impacts of climate change on their health. Consider the following action items:. Many workers are more vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change than the general population because:. EPA works to protect and improve human health and the environment. Helping vulnerable populations adapt to and protect themselves against climate impacts is a part of that. See additional resources on related EPA adaptation efforts:. A number of climate-related hazards threaten the health of certain groups of workers in the United States. Below are examples of the potential health impacts of these hazards.. Heat illnesses can occur when a person is exposed to high temperatures and their body cannot cool down. Millions of U.S. workers are regularly exposed to heat in their workplaces. As the climate changes, average and extreme temperatures are increasing,9, 10 along heat waves. These changes can put indoor and outdoor workers at greater risk of heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke and exhaustion, especially in jobs that are physically demanding.. Heat-related fatigue can also impact a worker’s alertness to job-related dangers, which can increase the chance of injury or death. Construction, utility, transportation, and other outdoor workers face additional risks from urban heat islands, which can intensify both daytime and nighttime temperatures., 14. Climate change will impact air quality in many ways. Some outdoor air pollutants (such as ground-level ozone and particulate matter from dust from droughts and wildfire smoke) are expected to increase. Outdoor workers, including agricultural and migrant workers, may be more exposed to these pollutants, which can lead to respiratory illnesses, including asthma., 18. As the climate changes, the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires will lead to increased respiratory health risks for firefighters. For example, firefighters exposed to smoke and other wildfire combustion products can experience lung inflammation and decreased lung function.. Earlier spring warming, precipitation changes, and rising temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations can increase the length and severity of the pollen season. Data show the ragweed pollen season is already becoming longer in some U.S. locations. Such changes mean that outdoor workers, such as farmers, ranchers, and other agricultural workers, may face more exposure to pollen and other allergens that cause hay fever or asthma.. Climate change can also affect indoor environments. Changes in the climate can worsen allergens and certain outdoor pollutants, which can then make their way indoors. Climate change can also increase the frequency and severity of some extreme weather events, including heavy rainfalls. More humidity and moisture can lead to increases in mold, bacteria, and pests, which can worsen asthma and other respiratory effects for indoor workers in damp environments.. Certain workers may be part of other groups vulnerable to climate change. This can increase their health risks. For example, some outdoor workers may also live in communities with poor air quality. Older adult workers with existing health conditions can be more sensitive to extreme heat. Workers who are part of immigrant populations can also be more vulnerable to climate hazards since they often have fewer means to prepare and cope.. As the climate changes, some extreme weather events are becoming more frequent or intense. Floods, storms, droughts, and wildfires often require complex emergency response, recovery, and rescue operations. These operations put many types of workers at risk, including first responders, health care workers, and those involved in pre- and post- disaster support.. Workers can experience both physical and mental health effects from these events. Physical impacts can include deaths, injuries, and illnesses. Mental health effectsExit EPA’s website can include anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.. Warmer temperatures associated with climate change can increase mosquito development and biting rates, while increased rainfall can create more breeding sites for mosquitoes.. Outdoor workers, such as agricultural workers, could be at higher risk of exposure to tick and insect bites that cause Lyme disease, West Nile virus, and other diseases. Most people who contract West Nile virusExit EPA’s website do not develop any symptoms, but in rare cases, people can experience serious illness and even die. Lyme diseaseExit EPA’s website can cause chronic pain and neurological problems if not treated early.. Changes in pest populations and distribution are expected to increase the use of pesticides in agriculture. Studies show that climate change has already contributed to an expanded range for ticks. These changes could increase pesticide exposures for agricultural workers. It could also put family members in danger if workers bring pesticide residues into their homes, such as on their skin, tools, and clothing. Sprayed pesticides can also drift into communities and homes close to farms, increasing residents’ risk.. Both employees and employers can take steps to reduce the health impacts of climate change, including:. The term “disability” covers a wide range of conditions that limit a person’s ability to do certain activities. There are many types of disabilities, including those that affect vision, hearing, speech, cognition, and mobility.. In 2019, there were more than 41 million U.S. adults living with a disability. People with disabilities may be more vulnerable to climate change than the general population because:. Photo caption endnote:7. EPA works to protect and improve human health and the environment. Helping vulnerable populations adapt to and protect themselves against climate impacts is a part of that. See additional resources on related EPA adaptation efforts:. In the United States, many climate-related threats affect the health of people with disabilities. Below are some examples of the potential health impacts of these hazards.. Heat illnesses can occur when a person is exposed to high temperatures and their body cannot cool down. Increases in average and extreme temperatures and heat waves are expected to lead to more heat illnessesExit EPA’s website and deaths among vulnerable groups, including people with disabilities. Some people with disabilities are especially at risk for heat-related illness and death. These include individuals with mental health issues, those who depend on others for assistance in daily living, and those with limited mobility or access to transportation.. Social factors can further compound this risk. For example, people with limited incomes may not be able to afford air conditioning in their home during heat waves, increasing their risk of heat stroke. Also, people with certain disabilities may not be adequately warned of an extreme heat hazard or what to do to stay safe. For example, important alerts are not always issued in ways that people with hearing or vision loss or blindness can receive or understand them.. Climate change will impact water resources in many ways. For example, changes in water and air temperatures, heavier and longer rains, flooding, and rising sea levels can introduce disease-carrying organisms into drinking water supplies and recreational waters. Drinking or coming in contact with untreated contaminated water can cause gastrointestinal illnesses and other health impacts. Emergency information (such as a warning to boil contaminated water) may not reach individuals who have hearing loss, are blind or have low vision, or have cognitive disabilities.. Some people with disabilities may be part of other groups vulnerable to climate change. This can increase their health risks. For example, childhood disability has been rising in recent years, with the rates highest among American Indian and Alaska Native children and those living in poverty.. As the climate changes, some extreme weather events (such as heat waves, flooding, and droughts) are becoming more frequent and/or more intense. These events can cause stress, depression, grief, or anxiety, which can affect people’s well-being and ability to function. People with disabilities are among the groups most vulnerable to mental health effects as the climate changes.. An increase in extreme weather can especially impact people with disabilities unless communities have a plan to assist these individuals before, during, and after an event. For example, without enough preparation, people with disabilities may not be able to evacuate safely. This can put them at greater risk of injury or death. In addition, power outages from an extreme event can affect medical equipment (such as portable oxygen) operation that many people with disabilities rely upon.. People with disabilities, as well as their families, loved ones, and caretakers, can take steps to reduce the health impacts of climate change. Consider the following action items:. Chronic medical conditions are those that last one year or more and either require ongoing medical attention, limit activities/daily living, or both. People with chronic medical conditions are more vulnerable than the general population to the health impacts of climate change because:. Photo caption endnote:11. EPA works to protect and improve human health and the environment. Helping vulnerable populations adapt to and protect themselves against climate impacts is a part of that. See additional resources on related EPA adaptation efforts:. A number of climate-related hazards threaten the health of people with chronic medical conditions. Below are some examples of the potential health impacts of these hazards.. Climate change will impact water resources in many ways. For example, changes in water and air temperatures, heavier and longer rains, flooding, and rising sea levels can introduce disease-carrying organisms into drinking water supplies and recreational waters., 15. Drinking or coming in contact with untreated contaminated water can cause gastrointestinal illnesses and other health impactsExit EPA’s website. People with certain chronic medical conditions, such as those with compromised immune systems, can be more at risk of having severe effects from a water-related illness.. Climate change may increase the likelihood of harmful algal blooms caused by certain types of algae and bacteria. Harmful algal blooms can make drinking and recreational water sources unsafe. For example, swimming in waters with a harmful algal bloom can cause respiratory illnesses and eye irritation. People with chronic respiratory diseases, specifically asthma, are at increased risk of illness from harmful algal blooms.. Photo caption endnote:21. Climate change may increase outdoor air pollutants, such as ground-level ozone and particulate matter in dust from droughts and wildfire smoke. People with conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and COPD are particularly vulnerable to adverse effects from exposure to these pollutants.. Climate change can also prolong the allergy season and increase pollen and other outdoor allergens. Data show the ragweed pollen season is already becoming longer in some U.S. locations. These allergens can worsen chronic respiratory conditions and contribute to the onset of asthma.. Indoor contaminants, such as bacteria and mold, could also increase as the climate changes due to more humidity and dampness from frequent heavy rains, storms, and floods. Asthmatics and people with compromised immune systems are more vulnerable to indoor air pollutants than the general population.. Photo caption endnote:27. Some people with chronic medical conditions may be part of other groups vulnerable to climate change. This can increase their health risks. For instance, low-income groups, people with limited English proficiency, certain immigrant groups, and communities of color have a greater incidence of chronic medical conditions such as heart and kidney disease, diabetes, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). Black or African American populations have higher rates of asthma, decreased lung function, and heart issues. Older adults and children can also have chronic medical conditions.. Heat illnesses can occur when a person is exposed to high temperatures and their body cannot cool down. Increases in average and extreme temperatures and heat waves are expected to lead to more heat illnesses and deaths among vulnerable groups, including older adults. Temperature extremes can worsen some chronic medical conditions, such as heart and respiratory disease and diabetes. At the same time, some medical conditions, such as obesity and heart disease, increase people’s sensitivity to heat, putting them at greater risk of heat illnesses. In addition, some medications (such as some antidepressants, diuretics, and beta-blockers) taken for a chronic illness may increase an individual’s sensitivity to heat by interfering with the body’s ability to regulate temperature, fluids, or electrolytes.. Photo caption endnote:32. Warmer temperatures associated with climate change can also increase mosquito development and biting rates, while increased rainfall can create more breeding sites for mosquitos.. Mosquitoes can transmit diseases, such as West Nile virusExit EPA’s website. These diseases pose a greater risk to people with compromised immune systems, who may be more likely to experience severe illness. Most people do not develop symptoms with West Nile virus. However, some develop serious illness and even die.. Studies show that climate change has already contributed to an expanded range for ticks. This could put more people at risk of contracting Lyme diseaseExit EPA’s website. Lyme disease can cause heart problems in some people. It can also cause chronic pain and neurological problems if not treated early.. Photo caption endnote:39. As of 2019, approximately 51. million (or one in five) U.S. adults live with a mental illness. Individuals with these conditions are particularly vulnerable to certain threats associated with climate change. For example, some medications used to treat mental illnesses increase a person’s risk for heat-related illness.. Certain conditions, such as different types of dementia, can affect an individual’s judgment or reactions, increasing the risk of harm during a weather-related disaster. People with an existing mental illness are also more at risk for distress and other mental health effects following such an event.. People with chronic medical conditions and their loved ones or caretakers can take steps to reduce the health impacts of climate change. Consider the following action items:. There were more than 75 million older adults (60 years or older) in the United States in 2019, making up over one-fifth of the population. Older adults are particularly vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change because:. Photo caption endnote:8. EPA works to protect and improve human health and the environment. Helping vulnerable populations adapt to and protect themselves against climate impacts is a part of that. See additional resources on related EPA adaptation efforts:. In the United States, many climate-related threats affect older adults’ health. Below are some examples of the potential health impacts of these hazards.. Heat illnesses can occur when a person is exposed to high temperatures and their body cannot cool down. Increases in average and extreme temperatures and heat waves are expected to lead to more heat illnesses and deaths among vulnerable groups, including older adults. Even small temperature increases may pose risks to older adults in some regions. Certain factors, such as preexisting medical conditions like diabetes, can further increase their risk.. Older adults who live in cities may also be subject to the urban heat island effect, where surfaces like pavements absorb sunlight and radiate heat, making cities hotter than outlying areas.. Photo caption endnote:16. Climate change may increase outdoor air pollutants, such as ground-level ozone and particulate matter in wildfire smoke and dust from droughts. Air pollution can increase the risk of heart attacks for older adults, especially those who are diabetic or obese. It can worsen conditions like asthma and COPD. Exposure to ground-level ozone can also harm lung functioning.. Earlier spring warming, precipitation changes, and rising temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations can increase the length and severity of the pollen season. Data show the ragweed pollen season is already becoming longer in some U.S. locations. Allergens like ragweed pollen can worsen existing respiratory conditions and contribute to the onset of asthma.. Older adults who live in buildings that are older or have poor ventilation may also be more at risk for exposure to indoor air pollutants. These pollutants can include bacteria and mold caused by water damage from extreme weather events, such as floods and storm surges.. Photo caption endnote:24. Older adults may be part of other groups vulnerable to climate change. This can increase their health risks. For example, some older adults can have multiple existing health conditions (such as heart disease, diabetes, dementia, and cancer) that put them at greater risk. Certain immigrant groups and communities of color have a greater incidences of kidney disease, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). Older adults can also be more at risk because of social and economic factors, such as fixed incomes, living alone, and lack of support networks.. Warmer temperatures associated with climate change can increase mosquito development and biting rates, while increased rainfall can create breeding sites for mosquitoes. West Nile virusExit EPA’s website, spread by mosquitoes, poses greater risks for older adults with compromised immune systems. Many people do not experience symptoms from West Nile virus. However, some people develop serious, and even fatal, sickness.. Studies show that climate change has already contributed to an expanded range for ticks. This could put more people, including older adults, at risk of contracting Lyme diseaseExit EPA’s website. Adults aged 55–69 have the highest numbers of confirmed and probable cases of Lyme disease in the United States. Lyme disease can cause chronic pain and neurological problems if not treated early.. Older adults often have limited mobility, making it difficult to get to safety during extreme weather events. Extreme events can also interrupt older adults’ medical care, making it hard for them to be transported with their correct medications, medical records, and health equipment. Power outages after a storm can also affect elevators, air conditioning or heat, and electronically powered medical equipment, making older adults particularly vulnerable. The National Institute on Aging has prepared a list of 6 Tips on How Older Adults Can Prepare for a DisasterExit EPA’s website.. Photo caption endnote:33. Extreme weather events like hurricanes, floods, and wildfires can cause emotional trauma. Older people who have cognitive disabilities like dementia can have a harder time responding to and coping with these events.. Other climate-related hazards can also contribute to mental health effects. For example, long-term exposure to air pollution is linked with faster cognitive decline in older adults.. Photo caption endnote:36. Climate change will impact water resources in many ways. For example, changes in water and air temperatures, heavier and longer rains, flooding, and rising sea levels can introduce disease-carrying organisms into drinking water supplies and recreational waters. Because many older adults have compromised immune systems, they have a higher risk for contracting gastrointestinal or other diseasesExit EPA’s website from untreated contaminated water. Water-related diseases can often be more severe for older adults and can sometimes lead to long-term illness or even death.. Climate change may also increase the likelihood of harmful algal blooms caused by certain types of algae and bacteria. Harmful algal blooms can make drinking and recreational water sources unsafe. For example, swimming in waters with a harmful algal bloom can cause respiratory illnesses and eye irritation. People with chronic respiratory diseases, specifically asthma, are at increased risk of illness from harmful algal blooms.. Older adults, their families, and caretakers can take steps to decrease the health impacts of climate change. Consider the following action items:. There are many different Indigenous populations in the United States. These include those native to the contiguous United States, Alaska Natives, and Pacific Islanders. Many of these groups are more vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change than the general population because:. Photo caption endnote:8. EPA works to protect and improve human health and the environment. Helping vulnerable populations adapt to and protect themselves against climate impacts is a part of that. See additional resources on related EPA adaptation efforts:. A number of climate-related hazards threaten the health of Indigenous populations in the United States. Below are some examples of the potential health impacts of these hazards.. Many Indigenous communities already lack safe drinking water and/or drinking water treatment infrastructure. This is particularly true for those located on remote lands. Another threat to water infrastructure is thawing permafrost. When permafrost thaws, it destabilizes the ground above it, affecting buildings and other infrastructure.. Untreated, contaminated drinking water can cause disease outbreaks and illnessesExit EPA’s website. For example, infants living on the Fort Apache reservation in Arizona have had higher hospitalization rates for diarrheal disease than infants in the general U.S. population.. Increasing water temperatures and other climate changes can also encourage the growth of harmful algal bloomsExit EPA’s website. People can get sick if they swim in, drink water, or eat fish or shellfish contaminated by a harmful algal bloom. In southeast Alaska, several tribes are working with government agencies to monitor harmful algal blooms. These efforts are helping to ensure the safety of subsistence shellfish harvests.. In Hawai‘i and the U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands, rising temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, and sea level rise threaten water supplies. Saltwater contamination from sea level rise is already affecting water supplies on some islands. In addition, severe droughts are already common and can lead to clean water shortages.. Photo caption endnote:17. Many Indigenous peoples already have trauma from colonization, removal from their homelands, and loss of traditional cultural practices. Climate change impacts to the natural environment are worsening this trauma in some areas.. Photo caption endnote:20. For example, the Isle de Jean Charles Band of Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw tribe in Louisiana has lost 98 percent of its land mass. This loss is largely due to erosion from severe storms, sea level rise, and development. The land loss has separated families as some individuals move to a new community. It has also greatly impacted the tribe’s culture, livelihoods, traditional foods, and sacred places.. In many Indigenous communities, relationships among people, wildlife, and the natural environment are important to mental and spiritual health. A changing climate is disrupting these connections and threatening social networks and knowledge-sharing. This can increase the risk of mental health impacts.. Some Indigenous peoples may be part of other groups vulnerable to climate change. This can increase their health risks. For instance, many Indigenous peoples have existing medical conditions that increase their sensitivity to climate hazards. They may also have greater exposures to health threats because of their living and working conditions. For example, many Indigenous communities struggle with poverty, inadequate infrastructure, and limited economic opportunities. These challenges further restrict their ability to cope with climate change threats.. Climate change affects the supply and quality of traditional foods, subsistence foods, and cultivated crops in many regions. For example, warming sea surface temperatures have been linked with increases in diseases and mercury levels in shellfish. This is affecting tribes on the West and Gulf Coasts and Alaska Natives. In the Northern Great Plains, reduced streamflow and warmer water temperatures are causing declines in salmon, trout, and mussels.. In Hawai‘i and the U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands, many communities gather food from the land and sea. Rising sea levels, high waves from storms, and ocean warming and acidification threaten these resources. Lack of access to traditional foods can lead to poor nutrition, obesity, diabetes, and mental health effects.. Thawing permafrost in some Alaska Native communities is posing threats to food security and people’s health. For example, some communities use ice cellars or ice houses to store food. As permafrost thaws, food spoilage and sickness may become more common without other storage options. However, some communities, like the Iñupiat in Alaska, are addressing the problem by improving or moving cellars and designing new technologies to improve food storage.. Climate change may increase outdoor air pollutants, such as ground-level ozone and particulate matter in wildfire smoke and dust from droughts. Blowing dust currently affects communities in the Southwest, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico. This dust is likely to worsen with increasing droughts.. Some Indigenous communities living near urban or industrial areas already are exposed to harmful air pollution. Air quality in these areas can worsen with climate change.. Exposure to dust, wildfire smoke, and certain air pollutants can cause or worsen asthma, pneumonia, bronchitis, and other respiratory conditions. Exposure to smoke-related pollutants in wildfires has also been linked to low infant birth weight.. Tribes, Indigenous organizations, government agencies, and others can help build resilience against climate change. Some actions include:. Certain groups are more vulnerable than others to the health impacts of climate change due to social and economic factors like income, education, health care access, and housing. Such factors can affect people’s ability to prepare and cope with climate hazards. Socially vulnerable groups in the United States include communities of color, low-income groups, certain immigrant groups, and those with limited English proficiency. These groups may be more at risk because:. Photo caption endnote:5, 6. EPA works to protect and improve human health and the environment. Helping vulnerable populations adapt to and protect themselves against climate impacts is a part of that. See additional resources on related EPA adaptation efforts:. A 2021 EPA report examines the degree to which certain socially vulnerable populations may be more exposed to the highest impacts of climate change.. A number of climate-related hazards threaten the health of socially vulnerable people in the United States. Below are some examples of the potential health impacts of these hazards.. Heat illnesses can occur when a person is exposed to high temperatures and their body cannot cool down. Increases in average and extreme temperatures and heat waves are expected to lead to more heat illnessesExit EPA’s website and deaths among vulnerable groups, including certain socially vulnerable groups. These include low-income households, communities of color, those experiencing homelessness, and immigrant populations.. Many of these groups live in urban areas that are prone to extreme heat (urban heat islands). Some may also live in housing that does not have adequate insulation or cooling. Others may not be able to afford air conditioning.. Photo caption endnote:12. Climate change may lead to more outdoor air pollutants, including particulate matter and ground-level ozone. These pollutants can affect some socially vulnerable people, such as those living in cities with high air pollution levels or those with limited access to measures to reduce their exposure., 14. Socially vulnerable groups are often more sensitive to air pollutants because they have more exposures and higher rates of underlying medical conditions. As a result, they are at a higher risk for developing severe illnesses, needing to go to a hospital, or prematurely dying.. In addition, climate change can increase allergens like pollen that can trigger or worsen asthma. Data show the ragweed pollen season is already becoming longer in some U.S. locations. Asthma is more common among some communities of color and low-income households than the general population.. Dust from agriculture and droughts can also affect individuals in rural communities. Wildfire smoke can be a hazard in both urban and rural areas. Low-income individuals who live in buildings that are older or in poor condition can be exposed to damp indoor environments. Dampness can increase mold, bacteria, and other indoor air pollutants, especially after floods and extreme weather events. Lower-income households may lack the resources to buy air cleaners that can help reduce some of these pollutants.. Photo caption endnote:20. Climate change will impact water resources in many ways. For example, changes in water and air temperatures, heavier and longer rains, flooding, and rising sea levels can introduce disease-carrying organisms into drinking water supplies and recreational waters. In both urban and rural low-income areas, water resources—such as sewer, stormwater, and drinking water systems—may be old or not able to withstand climate impacts such as storm surge and heavy rains. As a result, these areas can be more vulnerable to water quality issues.. Low-income households near floodplains can also be more exposed to water pollutants, particularly due to sea level rise, heavy rainfall, or extreme weather events. They may also have higher flood insurance costs and more difficulty getting insurance.. Certain people may be part of other groups vulnerable to climate change. This can increase their health risks. For example, an elderly person with a limited income and mobility issues may have trouble getting to a safe place during a heat wave. Some immigrants, communities of color, and low-income individuals may also have higher rates of chronic medical conditions that can be worsened by climate change impacts.. Climate-related hazards—especially floods, wildfires, and droughts—could affect food production and distribution. These issues, in turn, could impact food quality and availability.. Some communities of color and low-income populations already struggle to get nutritious food due to limited finances and access to grocery stores with good-quality, affordable options. Climate-related food shortages and supply chain issues could make it even more difficult for people to get healthy food.. Warmer temperatures brought on by a changing climate can increase mosquito development and biting rates. Increased rainfall or standing water from sea level rise can also create more breeding sites for mosquitoes.. Higher incidences of West Nile virus, which is transmitted by mosquitoes, have been linked to poverty in the Southeast and urban locations in the Northeast. While most people infected with West Nile virus do not feel ill, some develop more severe sicknesses.. As the climate changes, conditions are becoming more favorable to more extreme weather. Certain communities of color, lower-income individuals, rural populations, and immigrant groups are more likely to experience mental health effects from such events.. These groups may already face barriers to getting mental health care, counseling in native languages, and medication. Extreme weather can disrupt access to mental health care even further, which can cause or worsen mental health effects.. Photo caption endnote:33. Individuals, businesses, governments, and society as a whole can take action at different scales to ensure environmental justice and equity. These actions can ensure that all populations are equally protected from climate-related health hazards. Community members can consider the following actions:. Children, including adolescents under the age of 18, are often more vulnerable than the general population to the health impacts of climate change because:. Photo caption endnote:6. EPA works to protect and improve human health and the environment. Helping vulnerable populations adapt to and protect themselves against climate impacts is a part of that. See additional resources on related EPA adaptation efforts:. A 2023 EPA report\\xa0quantifies projected health effects to children from climate change.. The report considers factors such as extreme heat, air quality, changing seasons, flooding, and infectious diseases.. A number of climate-related hazards threaten the health of children in the United States. Below are examples of the potential health impacts of these hazards.. Climate change has the potential to increase outdoor air pollutants, such as dust from droughts, wildfire smoke, and ground-level ozone. Ground-level ozone and particulate matter are associated with increases in asthma and other respiratory conditions in children., 11 Climate change can also increase pollen and prolong the allergy season. Higher outdoor temperatures can lead to children spending more time indoors, where they can be exposed to indoor pollutants, such as tobacco smoke and mold.. Photo caption endnote:12. Extreme heat events are expected to last longer and become more frequent and intense as the climate changes. Heat illnesses can occur when a person is exposed to high temperatures and their body cannot cool down. Increases in average and extreme temperatures are expected to lead to more heat illnesses and deaths among vulnerable groups, including children. Heat can affect children who spend time outdoors playing and exercising.. Young athletes are at particular risk of heat stroke and heat illnesses. Children who live in homes without air conditioning are also at risk. Young children and infants are particularly vulnerable to heat-related illnesses and death, as their bodies are less able to adapt to heat.. Photo caption endnote:17. Runoff from more frequent and intense rains, flooding, and coastal storms can introduce more pollutants and disease-carrying organisms into water bodies where children swim and play or that communities use as drinking water supplies.. These contaminants can impact drinking water supplies and recreational waters. Untreated, contaminated water can cause gastrointestinal illnesses for any individual drinking or coming into contact with itExit EPA’s website;20 however, children have a higher risk of gastrointestinal illness if they come in contact with contaminated water than adults., 22. Increasing water temperatures associated with climate change can also encourage the growth of bacteria and harmful algae in coastal waters. This can lead to harmful algal bloomsExit EPA’s website, which can make people sick if they swim or play near them. Because of the ways children tend to behave in water, they are at greater risk for getting sick compared to adults. In some areas, rising air and water temperatures will also extend the swimming season, increasing children’s risks of getting gastrointestinal and other water-related diseases, as well as eye and ear infections.. Photo caption endnote:26. When children are also part of other groups vulnerable to climate change, this compound effect can increase their health risks. For instance, Native American/Alaska Native infants are hospitalized more for diarrheal disease than infants in the general U.S. population—often due to a lack of safe and reliable drinking water. Extreme rainfall and warmer temperatures, which have been linked to bacterial contamination of drinking water, are expected to further impact tribal water supplies. In addition, children in low-income households and non-white children are more likely to be exposed to extreme heat and air pollution. They are also less able to escape from extreme weather events.. Climate change is expanding the habitat ranges and length of time when insects and ticks are common. In some regions, that results in a northward expansion of where ticks may live; while other areas could also see ticks active for longer periods throughout the year. Warmer temperatures associated with climate change can also increase mosquito development and biting rates, while increased rainfall can create breeding sites for mosquitos.. Because children spend a lot of time outdoors, they are vulnerable to insect and tick bites that can cause illnesses like West Nile virusExit EPA’s website and Lyme diseaseExit EPA’s website. In rare cases, West Nile virus can lead to serious or fatal sickness. Separately, studies show that children between the ages of 5 and 9 report a higher frequency of Lyme disease compared to most other age groups. Lyme disease can cause chronic pain and neurological problems if not treated early.. Proper nutrition is essential for children’s physical and mental growth. Extreme events, such as wildfires, floods, heat waves, and droughts may disrupt food production and distribution, increase costs, and limit availability. These impacts could make it harder for children to get healthy food. Diseases, pests, and water shortages can also affect crop productivity and quality.. Most U.S. households are currently food secureExit EPA’s website. This means they have consistent, dependable access to enough food for active, healthy living. But millions of households with children experience food insecurity at times during the year. This means their access to adequate food is limited by a lack of money and other resources.. Climate change may affect certain disease-causing organisms in the food chain. For instance, Escherichia coli (E. coli) could increase with a warmer and more humid climate. These climate changes, combined with other social and economic factors, may increase children’s vulnerability to some food-related illnesses. For example, children are more prone to severe illness or complications from E. coli infections.. Photo caption endnote:38. Children who go through a natural disaster or extreme weather event may have anxiety, depression, trouble sleeping, phobias, and post-traumatic stress. Children’s ability to cope with these events depends on many factors, including their living situation and support systems. There may be a perception that children are resilient to traumatic events. However, mental health impacts may last into adulthood, especially if left untreated.. Parents, caregivers, coaches, and school administrators can take steps to reduce the health impacts of climate change on children. Consider the following action items:. The U.S. transportation system is essential to moving people and goods. It includes:. Although the nation’s transportation system is built to withstand weather, climate change may affect this system over time. The impacts will vary by region. However, impacts in one region can readily affect another. For example, bridge damage in one place can cause road congestion in another. Changing water levels in one area may affect shipping nationwide.. Economic impacts. Climate change can have pros and cons for U.S. shipyards, which support around $40 billion in gross domestic product. For example, warmer weather might lengthen shipping seasons, but more intense rainfall could interrupt cargo movement.. Damage to transportation systems. More than 60,000 miles of U.S. roads and bridges in coastal areas are at risk of flooding and damage from climate-change-related sea level rise.. Disrupted mobility. The New York City metro area provided extra bus service after Superstorm Sandy to make up for flooded subway and commuter tunnels. As the climate changes, providing multiple modes of transit will be important.. Hazardous conditions. About 80% of the ground in Alaska has permafrost underneath it. Thawing permafrost from a warming climate could affect the roads and structures on top of it, leading to damage and accidents.. Safety risks. As the climate changes, heat and other extreme weather can cause equipment issues, delays, passenger discomfort, and safety risks for travelers and workers.. Economic impacts. Climate change can have pros and cons for U.S. shipyards, which support around $40 billion in gross domestic product. For example, warmer weather might lengthen shipping seasons, but more intense rainfall could interrupt cargo movement.. Damage to transportation systems. More than 60,000 miles of U.S. roads and bridges in coastal areas are at risk of flooding and damage from climate-change-related sea level rise.. In addition, transportation interacts with and depends on other sectors of the economy, such as water resources and energy. Therefore, climate impacts on these sectors can also affect the transportation system.. Fortunately, communities can take many steps to help safeguard our transportation system. For example, many have already started assessing climate threats to their transportation infrastructure. Engineers are developing solutions to help bolster system resilience. Planners are taking into consideration climate data when they design, construct, and maintain transportation projects. Government agencies are supporting these efforts with funding and tools.. Explore the sections on this page to learn more about climate change impacts on transportation:. Climate change can disrupt transportation networks, stress infrastructure, and pose safety risks to people. The transportation sector also emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere that contribute to climate change. Read more about greenhouse gas emissions on the Basics of Climate Change page.. Climate change may affect transportation at local, regional, and national scales. Three key impacts are described in this section.. In many regions, sea level rise, changes in precipitation, extreme weather, and heat pose risks to the transportation system. These hazards may affect system performance, safety, and reliability. In coastal regions, rising sea levels and more extreme storms can lead to more storm surge and flooding, which can damage roads, bridges, railways, ports, and coastal airports. Increased local flooding can affect roadways and tunnels, weaken roadway materials, and cause traffic congestion. As a result, people may have trouble getting to their homes, schools, stores, and medical appointments.\\xa0\\xa0. Across inland regions, heavy rains can cause flooding and mudslides, affecting highways, railways, and bridges.,10\\xa0 Lack of rain can also be a concern. Drought combined with extreme heat increases wildfire risk. Wildfires can damage transportation networks and impair drivers’ visibility.. Rising temperatures can affect transportation in many regions. These impacts can be both immediate and long-lasting. For example, heat affects runways, and hotter air can make it more difficult for airplanes to take flight. Heat can also damage rail tracks and cause cracks in roads. In addition, heat can pose safety risks to transportation workers and travelers. For example, vehicles can overheat and roadway joints can buckle, leading to accidents.. Warmer temperatures can also cause permafrost to thaw. Permafrost currently supports roads, airport runways, pipelines, and railroads in Alaska. Thawing permafrost can weaken this critical infrastructure.. Climate change can have both positive and negative impacts on transportation system costs. For example, milder winters in some regions could cut the costs of winter road maintenance. However, other areas may see more damage to roads, bridges, and transit systems from heat, weather, and rising sea levels. As a result, costs to maintain, repair, and replace infrastructure are likely to increase.\\xa0. Climate change impacts on transportation can also have wide economic effects. One positive impact is that warmer weather could lengthen the shipping season for some northern ports. Damage to the transportation system, however, can interrupt the supply chain at local, regional, and national levels.. In some coastal areas, more flooding is occurring as the sea level rises. Urban areas where there is a lot of pavement or where sewer systems cannot handle intense rainfall also are prone to flooding. Flooding disrupts the movement of commuters, tourists, and freight. People also need reliable transportation to get to their jobs. Extreme weather can disrupt transit options and damage roads, keeping people from getting to work.. Climate-related impacts on the transportation system affects both urban and rural areas. For example, in urban areas, heavy rains can flood tunnels and underground rail stops, affecting residents’ ability to access critical services and necessities. However, people in cities may also have other transportation options, including walking.\\xa0. In rural areas, there are typically fewer roads and transportation options than in cities. A single damaged road or bridge can cut off people’s access to services and necessities, such as food or medicine. Rural communities can also face rebuilding challenges, including being able to bring in construction materials.. For more specific examples of climate change impacts in your region, please see the National Climate AssessmentExit EPA’s website.. Transportation is critical to the nation’s economy. It links homes, workplaces, and communities. It supports tourism and provides a lifeline during emergencies. It also connects manufacturers with supplies and consumers with essential goods and products.\\xa0. In 2020, the demand for transportation services contributed about $1. trillion to the U.S. gross domestic product. Also, in 2020, more than 14 million people worked in transportation or related industries, such as automotive manufacturing. The number of people employed in the transportation sector in 2020 represents 10% of the U.S. workforce.. The costs of inaction are steep, especially if emissions continue to rise unabated and infrastructure is not adapted to the changing climate. This “business as usual” scenario is projected to cause hundreds of billions of dollars of damage per year by 2090. Further, climate change impacts on transportation infrastructure can disrupt the lives of the many people who use U.S. roads and bridges every day.\\xa0. Some groups are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts on transportation. For example, more than 25 million Americans have disabilities that make traveling outside their home difficult. People with disabilities are more likely to use public transit, so they can be greatly affected when these services are disrupted.. Low-income households, older adults, and those who speak limited English often have fewer transportation options. Disruptions to these networks can further reduce access to services and resources, especially during emergencies. Studies anticipate that coastal flooding due to sea level rise will also disproportionately affect minority and low-income communities.. Some rural and Indigenous communities also are at higher risk of climate-related transportation disruptions given their remote locations. For instance, detours caused by closed or damaged bridges are three times longer in rural areas than elsewhere. In remote communities, any impacts to the transportation system can affect people’s ability to access essential services. In Alaska, many Indigenous peoples are now even facing the possibility of relocation due to threats such as thawing permafrost, flooding, and erosion. These impacts threaten the existence of entire communities.. Municipal, state, and national leaders—as well as individuals—can reduce climate change’s impacts on transportation in many ways, including the following:. See additional actions you can take, as well as steps that companies can take, on EPA’s What You Can Do About Climate Change page.. Learn more about some of the key indicators of climate change related to this sector from EPA’s Climate Change Indicators in the United States:. The ocean is an essential part of the global environment. It influences climate and weatherExit EPA’s website around the world and is home to millions of different forms of life. Thriving marine ecosystems provide Americans with food, medicines, jobs, and recreation. The ocean also connects people to nature and is critical to some Native cultures.. Decreases in commercial fishing harvests. America’s East Coast is projected to see a 20% to 30% decrease in fish harvests by 2060. Climate change will drive fish further north as waters heat up.. Coral bleaching. Coral reefs are home to many sea creatures. When water is too warm or too cold, coral becomes damaged in a process called bleaching. If bleaching goes on for too long, it can kill the coral.. Dead Zones. Harmful algal blooms (HABs), sometimes called red tides, have been linked to increasing temperatures in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Some species of HABs can produce excessive amounts of biomass that can prevent light from getting below the ocean surface. As these organisms die and decompose, oxygen levels go down, making it harder for other organisms to survive. Other species of HABs can produce toxins that are hazardous to marine life and humans.. Threats to subsistence fishing. Salmon and other types of fish are an essential part of subsistence fishing in Alaska. Climate change is making it difficult for Indigenous people to practice fishing traditions.. Wildlife impacts. A 2014 marine heatwave caused the death of many sea lions. The warm water caused the fish that the sea lions eat to move elsewhere. As a result, thousands of sea lion pups starved.. Decreases in commercial fishing harvests. America’s East Coast is projected to see a 20% to 30% decrease in fish harvests by 2060. Climate change will drive fish further north as waters heat up.. Coral bleaching. Coral reefs are home to many sea creatures. When water is too warm or too cold, coral becomes damaged in a process called bleaching. If bleaching goes on for too long, it can kill the coral.. Increasing emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels are causing changes in the ocean (see box). These changes can alter which species of marine life thrive best in certain areas. For example, many fish have shifted their typical range as water temperatures rise. However, other species are expected to decline in number or leave areas that are no longer favorable for them. These shifts can have significant impacts on marine ecosystems and on fishing communities.. Many climate change impacts will only be avoided by reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Climate-driven changes in the ocean are motivating people to find solutions to the new challenges. For example, new forecast tools are helping predict changes in ocean conditions that can help the fishing industry adapt. Many organizations are working together to protect coral reefsExit EPA’s website, which face hazards such as bleaching, infectious diseases, smothering from sediment, collapses in fish stocks, and other issues. Such strategies can help preserve and protect marine resources. Even with these efforts, however, it will take decades or longer for the ocean to recover.. Explore the sections on this page to learn more about climate impacts on the ocean and marine resources:. Human-caused carbon dioxide emissions are affecting the ocean in three main ways:. Climate change affects the ocean in many ways. Three key impacts are described in this section.. Climate changes to the physical and chemical makeup of the ocean have significant impacts on marine ecosystems. For example, water temperature influences which species can live in an area. Acidification affects many animals’ ability to make shells or skeletons, while low oxygen levels can contribute to hypoxia, or dead zonesExit EPA’s website. Warm temperatures can exacerbate the effects of both acidification and hypoxia.. Impacts on one species can ripple across an entire ecosystem. For example, plankton—tiny organisms at the bottoms of many marine food chainsExit EPA’s website—are sensitive to water temperatures and oxygen concentrations. They can die off if the water gets too warm. Animals farther up the food chain, like whales, can suffer food shortages when this happens.\\xa0. Climate changes to the marine environment will come in many forms. For instance, the diversity of some temperate ecosystems is expected to increase. But overall, climate change is projected to disrupt marine ecosystems in ways that reduce the services they provide and their diversity of life.. Rising water temperatures, acidification, and low oxygen levels can combine with natural ocean cyclesExit EPA’s website to create extreme marine events. Marine heat waves, dead zones, and coral bleaching are just a few examples of these events, which are projected to become more common and severe. Extreme events can harm marine ecosystems and communities connected to these systems. For example, a large heat wave off the West Coast in 2014 shut down crab fisheries and starved baby sea lions.. Commercial and recreational marine fisheriesExit EPA’s website in some regions are at high risk from climate-driven changes in the size and distribution of fish populations. Some fish species have already altered their geographic range in response to climate change. For example, pollock and cod are moving north to colder water as local ocean temperatures rise.. The movement of fish into new areas disrupts the ecosystems that they move into. It can also cause confusion about what fishing regulations apply. Changes in where fish live may also mean boats have to travel further from ports, potentially increasing costs.. Climate change is also affecting the timing of seasonal events, which can affect fisheries. For example, some species, such as striped bass, are spawning earlier in the year. This means that catches can peak earlier than normal. Fisheries will need to adapt to such changes or risk reduced catches and lost revenues, which can also increase prices for consumers.. Changes in the locations and number of fish species in the ocean can present new opportunities in some cases. For example, scientists predict that some areas, such as the Bering Sea, will see more kinds of fish as warming waters drive populations north. This could lead to new fishing opportunities and economic growth in that region.. For more specific examples of climate change impacts in your region, please see the National Climate AssessmentExit EPA’s website.. Many U.S. industries depend on the ocean. The marine economy generated over $665 billion in sales in 2019, with tourism and recreation, including recreational fishing, making up more than one-third of that total. The marine economy also generated $397 billion in gross domestic product (GDP), which was 1.% of the national GDP.. Commercial fisheries are an important contributor to the economy. In 2019, they produced 9. billion pounds of seafood valued at $5. billion. Other businesses, such as grocery stores, tackle shops, and restaurants, also benefit from fishery-related products and services.. As of 2019, almost 2. million Americans had jobs related to the ocean in fields including fisheries, construction, tourism, real estate, food service, and transportation. The Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are both key trade channels for importing and exporting goods. The United States also extracts oil, gas, sand, and gravel from the ocean.. The ocean also provides many benefits that are harder to measure in economic terms. These are called ecosystem services. Carbon storage, water filtration, and shoreline protection are just a few of the many ecosystem services that the ocean provides. . Healthy oceans provide Americans with food and employment and are important to cultural traditions. Climate change leaves communities that depend on the ocean vulnerable to hardship. Many fishing communities already experience high rates of poverty. Unstable fish populations and market pricing can hurt fishing communities’ earnings. This is especially true if a community depends on a single species for their livelihoods.. Ocean health is a cornerstone of many Indigenous cultures. Native American, Pacific Islander, and Alaska Native communities often practice subsistence fishing.,28 Fluctuating fish populations can lead to food insecurity for rural Alaskan villages, where many people depend on locally caught fish for a large portion of their diet. For example, populations of Chinook and chum salmon hit record lows in 2021, leading to the closure of subsistence salmon fishing for much of the year. The number of shellfish, another important part of subsistence diets, has also been declining due to ocean acidification.. Climate change also affects Indigenous people culturally. Gathering and preparing food provide social, spiritual, and economic benefits for Indigenous communities.,33 Disruptions to subsistence practices have negative health outcomes such as anxiety disorders and feelings of isolation. . We can help reduce the impact of climate change on the marine environment in many ways, including the following:\\xa0. See additional actions you can take, as well as steps that companies can take, on EPA’s What You Can Do About Climate Change page.. Learn more about some of the key indicators of climate change related to this sector from EPA’s Climate Change Indicators in the United States:. Health is key to our well-being, happiness, and general quality of life. It is also important for economic progress and productivity. A person’s health may depend on many factors, such as their income, race, gender, age, existing medical conditions or genetics, occupation, and where they live. Personal choices and social support structures also play a role in a person’s health.. Climate change also affects people’s health in many ways. As the climate changes, more people may be exposed to extreme weather like heat, floods, droughts, storms, and wildfires. These events can cause illness, injury, and even death. Climate change can also lead to more diseases spread by insects and ticks, and it can affect the quality and safety of air, water, and food, including through the spread of harmful bacteria or viruses. In addition, hazards related to climate change can stress people’s mental health. For information on how climate change can affect the health of different groups of people, see Climate Change and Health.. Impacts on safe drinking water. As the climate changes, sea levels are rising in some areas. Pacific island communities are already experiencing saltwater contamination of groundwater systems due to sea level rise.. Worse air quality. Climate change is expected to worsen air pollution, which can pose health risks like heart and lung diseases. Low-income households and people of color often already live near factories, ports, and major roadways that emit air pollutants and make them more vulnerable.. Increases in heat-related illnesses. Extreme heat is already the leading cause of weather-related deaths in the United States. As temperatures rise with climate change, heat waves are expected to become more frequent and more intense.. Increases in mental health effects. About 30% of all first responders develop depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder after responding to a natural disaster or extreme weather event. Climate change is increasing the frequency and/or intensity of some of these events, putting more first responders at risk.. Difficulty accessing health care. In some places—such as certain rural areas—people can have trouble getting health care since there are fewer hospitals and transportation options. Extreme weather worsened by climate change, like floods and storms, can make it even harder for people to access medical facilities.. Impacts on safe drinking water. As the climate changes, sea levels are rising in some areas. Pacific island communities are already experiencing saltwater contamination of groundwater systems due to sea level rise.. Worse air quality. Climate change is expected to worsen air pollution, which can pose health risks like heart and lung diseases. Low-income households and people of color often already live near factories, ports, and major roadways that emit air pollutants and make them more vulnerable.. While the health effects of a changing climate are wide-ranging, communities, health care providers, and individuals can all take steps to lessen these impacts. For example, many government agencies already use the national public warning systemExit EPA’s website to communicate extreme weather threats. Some hospitals are climate-proofing their buildings and becoming more energy efficient. Many cities and individuals are planting trees to reduce the impacts of heat on people’s health.. Explore the sections on this page to learn more about climate impacts on health:. Climate change can disrupt access to health care services, threaten infrastructure, and pose physical and mental health risks. However, health care facilities also emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere that contribute to climate change. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from these facilities could reduce the overall cost of health care, benefit the economy, and save lives. Read more about greenhouse gas emissions on the Basics of Climate Change page.. Health impacts from climate change vary depending on factors like a person’s age, medical condition, income, and where they live. Four key impacts are described in this section.. As the climate changes, some extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and/or intense, \\xa0posing risks to people’s health and safety. For instance, droughts can create dust, which can lead to respiratory illness. Storms and floods can cause injuries, damage to homes and buildings, and infections from contaminated water. Weather can also keep people from getting to doctor’s offices and emergency care. Disrupted services are a particular risk for those who need regular medical care, such as older adults, pregnant women, infants, children, or people with chronic illnesses.. Temperatures are also likely to rise in many places as the climate changes. Exposure to extreme or prolonged heat can cause exhaustion, heat stroke, kidney and heart disease, and pregnancy complications.,10 In fact, extreme heat is already the leading cause of weather-related deaths in the United States.. Extreme weather and heat caused by a changing climate affects the quality of water, food, and air. Rising temperatures can lead to harmful algal blooms, many of which produce toxins that make people sick. Increased rainfall, storms, and flooding can contaminate water resources with viruses and bacteria, causing gastrointestinal and other illnesses. Rising temperatures also contribute to drought and reduced snowpack, ultimately reducing the availability of certain drinking water supplies.. Photo caption endnote:26. Climate change impacts on food vary widely. Longer growing seasons may be helpful for some crops, but detrimental to others. Taken together, these changes will present added challenges to farmers looking to plant successful crops that sustain their livelihood. A warmer climate may also lead to more pests or limit the types of crops that can grow in an area. This may make it harder for some people to access safe, nutritious food. In addition, climate change may increase people’s exposure to certain bacteria that can cause illnesses, such as Salmonella or E. coli.. Climate-related extreme weather and heat can worsen air quality. Wildfires and dust from droughts can increase outdoor air pollution. Hot weather can increase ground-level ozone. Bacteria and mold from flooding can lead to pollutants indoors. Poor air quality poses human health risks, including heart disease and stroke, asthma and other respiratory diseases, pregnancy complications, and some cancers.,21. Warmer temperatures have widened the range where ticks can live. Ticks may carry Lyme diseaseExit EPA’s website, which can cause long-term illness if not treated properly. Since 1991, the incidence of Lyme disease in the United States has nearly doubled.. Warmer temperatures also create conditions that help mosquitoes thrive. For example, among several factors that can affect West Nile virusExit EPA’s website transmission, mild winters, which may be more frequent due to climate change, have been linked to outbreaks of the disease.. Both immediate and long-term climate change effects can contribute to mental health challenges, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. For instance, climate-related natural disasters can be traumatic, especially for children. Natural disasters can lead to a loss of stability, community, and sometimes one’s home or property. Households that experience floods report higher levels of anxiety and depression, sometimes for years afterwards. Natural disasters and droughts can also lead to more tobacco and alcohol use, as well as domestic violence.,\\xa029 In addition, heat overall has been linked to increases in violence.. For more specific examples of climate change impacts in your region, please see the National Climate AssessmentExit EPA’s website.. Compromised health conditions—both short- and long-term—can pose major costs to people, communities, and businesses. These illnesses can hinder economic growth and limit people’s opportunities to work, attend school, and maintain their social relationships.. Physical and mental health conditions can make it harder for people to do their jobs and can lead to missed workdays and lost wages. Missed workdays due to chronic medical conditions cost U.S. employers billions of dollars every year.. Some people will be more affected by climate change than others because of social and economic factors. For instance, low-income households may live in aging or poorly constructed buildings that lack adequate cooling during heat waves. These households may also struggle to prepare for and recover from storms, floods, and other climate-related disasters. Those with limited financial resources also may lack adequate health insurance or access to health care.. For Native American, Pacific Islander, and Alaska Native communities, a changing climate might threaten traditional crops or other food sources. This could cause food insecurity and mental health impacts for some people in these communities.. In Alaska, thawing permafrost affects the structure of grounds and roads, which can lead to injuries and community displacement for Tribe members. Tribes in remote or rural areas may also have less access to clean, safe water as climate impacts, such as flooding, increase.. Some groups, like immigrants and communities of color, may face discrimination, language barriers, and other obstacles that can exclude them from community planning processes. As a result, their neighborhoods may be less prepared for climate change. They may also have a harder time accessing information to help them become more resilient. At the same time, minority communities may be at higher risk of certain chronic illnesses, such as asthma or heart disease. Climate change effects, like poor air quality and increased heat, can worsen these illnesses.. People with chronic illnesses or disabilities may experience disruptions to their medical care during weather emergencies. In addition, alerts and instructions may not be accessible for people with certain disabilities, such as hearing loss, vision loss, or some cognitive disabilities. People with limited mobility may also have a harder time getting to safety or accessing medical care.. Health care facilities, communities, and individuals can reduce climate change’s impacts on human health in many ways. Some actions include:. Learn more about some of the key indicators of climate change related to this sector from EPA’s Climate Change Indicators in the United States:. Forests and woodlands cover more than 822 million acres of land in the United States—about 36% of the country’s total land. There are many types of forests, including tropical forests, pine forests, and deciduous forests, with trees that shed their leaves annually. Forests are found on coasts, in wetlands, in dry inland regions, in areas with cold and warm climates, and even in cities.. More invasive species in forests. In the northeastern and midwestern United States, invasive garlic mustard plants can take nutrients away from native species. As climate change leads to changes in forest health, invasive species may spread more easily.. Forest structure changes. In the U.S. Southeast, sea level rise and warmer weather could cause mangrove forests to spread into salt marshes along the coast. This could change the balance of other species living in these ecosystems.. Economic impacts. Outdoor activities can be a key source of income for rural areas. In northwest Massachusetts, communities banded together to create the Mohawk Trail Woodlands PartnershipsExit EPA’s website to help keep the region’s forests—and economy—healthy.. Forest losses from wildfires. In 2020, wildfires burned over 10 million acres of U.S. lands, the highest-ever amount on record. Wildfires are expected to become more frequent and intense as the climate warms.. Insect damage to trees. Bark beetles eat away at trees. As the climate changes, warmer temperatures can lead to bark beetle population growth. Since 2000, bark beetles are thought to have damaged as much forest area as wildfires.. More invasive species in forests. In the northeastern and midwestern United States, invasive garlic mustard plants can take nutrients away from native species. As climate change leads to changes in forest health, invasive species may spread more easily.. Forest structure changes. In the U.S. Southeast, sea level rise and warmer weather could cause mangrove forests to spread into salt marshes along the coast. This could change the balance of other species living in these ecosystems.. Forests provide clean air and water, recreational opportunities, food, goods, and (ecosystem) services. Forests also connect people with nature and play an important role in the culture and survival of some Indigenous peoples.. Climate plays an important role in the makeup, function, and health of forests. Therefore, changes in climate, such as in temperature and precipitation, can have direct impacts on forests. These impacts vary by region and forest type. Some impacts may be beneficial while others could be damaging. For example, a warmer climate may increase tree growth in some forests but decrease it in others.. Some forests may be able to respond to climate changes more successfully than others. For instance, forests that are fragmentedExit EPA’s website into smaller patches may be less able to adapt than those that are well connected. Fortunately, forests are long-lived and naturally resistant to some climate variation. In addition, people can take many steps to help make forests more resilient to climate change.. Explore the sections on this page to learn more about climate impacts on forests:. Forests are a critical part of the carbon cycle and can help to lessen the impacts of climate change worldwide. Forests absorb carbon as they grow, acting as a carbon storage “bank” that helps to offset fossil fuel emissions. If trees are cut or burned, a forest temporarily releases part of this stored carbon to the atmosphere. When forests are converted to other uses, such as farming or development, they permanently release nearly all their carbon.\\xa0. Climate change may affect forests at both local and regional scales. The impacts can vary even within a single forest. Three key impacts are described in this section.. Climate change will influence a number of natural disturbancesExit EPA’s website that threaten forest health. These include insect outbreaks, invasive species, wildfires, and storms. Some disturbances, like a wildfire, take place quickly. Others, like changes in animal or plant populations, happen over decades to centuries. Some of their effects may be temporary, allowing a forest to recover. In other cases, a forest may suffer lasting impacts.. Some forests may benefit from certain climate impacts. For instance, warmer temperatures can lead to more tree and plant growth in regions where cold weather limits the growing season. However, in other forests, warmer temperatures may allow invasive species to thrive.,12\\xa0Warmer weather can also encourage insect survivial and growth. Over the past decade, climate change has led to an increase in bark beetle damageExit EPA’s website to mountain pines in parts of the West.. Disturbances can also interact with one another to increase risks to forests. For example, drought can weaken trees and make a forest more vulnerable to wildfire or insect outbreaks. Similarly, wildfires can make a forest more vulnerable to pests. Climate impacts can also interact with other stressors, like land development, that decrease a forest’s ability to adapt.. Climate change is expected to affect forests’ ability to provide key ecosystem services, including carbon storage, clean air, water supply, recreation, and wildlife habitat. One of the most important ecosystem services forests provide is absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in roots, soil, aboveground tree growth, and the forest floor.\\xa0. Climate change can affect carbon storage in several ways. For example, it may bring more frequent and intense rainfall to some regions. Heavy precipitation and flooding can erode forest soils and cause stored carbon to be released back into the atmosphere. Damage to forests from more wildfires, insects, and disease outbreaks can also release stored carbon.. Another key ecosystem service that forests provide is water for drinking, irrigation, recreation, and other uses. Forest watersheds also moderate extreme weather impacts, such as flooding from heavy rainfall, on downstream communities and ecosystems.. Droughts, wildfires, rising temperatures, and reduced snowfall and snowpack due to climate change can all limit a watershed’s ability to provide these services. For example, more frequent or severe droughts could reduce streamflow in some forests. Less streamflow means less water may be available for people to use. Reduced streamflow can also affect some plants and animals, such as fish that migrate to certain streams to reproduce.. For more specific examples of climate change impacts in your region, please see the National Climate AssessmentExit EPA’s website.. Every day, Americans use a wide array of forest products including paper and packaging materials, lumber, and construction materials. The forest-products industry employs over 900,000 people in the United States. It also generates over $200 billion a year in sales and makes up about 6% of the U.S. manufacturing gross domestic product.. In addition, forests provide important ecosystem servicesExit EPA’s website, such as clean air and water, climate regulation, wildlife habitat, and carbon storage. These services are often perceived as “free,” but they have great value. Some forests also provide opportunities for outdoor recreation, a source of revenue and economic growth for many regions. . Certain communities may be more affected by climate change impacts on forests than others. For example, some Indigenous peoples rely on forests for medicine, food, or ceremonial practices. If they cannot access these resources, their diet, mental health, and cultural identity may be impacted.,30 Tribes in remote or rural areas may already lack access to wastewater-treatment services and safe drinking water supplies. Climate impacts on the forest watershed can worsen these Tribes’ water security.. Many rural communities benefit from their location near scenic forests. Climate change impacts on these forests may disrupt tourism and outdoor activities that are key sources of revenue for these communities.. Urban forests—such as parks, gardens, and nature preserves—provide important benefits to neighborhoods within cities. As the climate changes, impacts like extreme weather, heat, and soil and air quality changes can stress urban forests. This may affect their ability to provide cooling and other key services, particularly for those people most in need. For example, low-income households may be less able to afford air conditioning. People with certain medical conditions can also be more sensitive to heat, putting them at greater risk.. We can reduce climate change’s impacts on forests and improve the resiliency of forested areas in many ways, including the following:. See additional actions you can take, as well as steps that companies can take, on EPA’s What You Can Do About Climate Change page.. Learn more about some of the key indicators of climate change related to this sector from EPA’s Climate Change Indicators in the United States:. Clean freshwater, comprising both groundwater and surface waters, is essential to life on Earth. People need water for drinking and sanitation, and all plants and animals need water to survive. Water also supports agriculture, energy production, navigation, manufacturing, and many other uses. In addition, freshwater supports many ecosystems and provides habitat and breeding grounds for animals.. Increased runoff and harmful algal blooms. In the summer, algae develop on Lake Erie due to excess agricultural runoff and warm water temperatures. As a result, a dead zone forms at the bottom of the lake that cannot support wildlife. Water bodies like Lake Erie may become more stressed as more frequent and intense rain events lead to more runoff.. Less water for drinking. Climate change is likely to increase people’s demands on water while also decreasing water supplies in some parts of the country.. Less water for agriculture. The Midwest produces many high-value “specialty” crops, such as apples, cherries, and pumpkins. These crops are particularly sensitive to drought and other climate stressors that can decrease water supplies for agriculture.. Groundwater depletion. The use of groundwater for crop irrigation has increased significantly over the past century. Irrigation accounts for 70% of all groundwater withdrawals nationwide.. More infrastructure failures. As the climate changes, more frequent and intense rainfall can threaten dams in some regions of the country. In fact, more than 15,000 dams in the United States have been identified as “high risk” for potential failure.. Increased runoff and harmful algal blooms. In the summer, algae develop on Lake Erie due to excess agricultural runoff and warm water temperatures. As a result, a dead zone forms at the bottom of the lake that cannot support wildlife. Water bodies like Lake Erie may become more stressed as more frequent and intense rain events lead to more runoff.. Less water for drinking. Climate change is likely to increase people’s demands on water while also decreasing water supplies in some parts of the country.. Climate change affects where, when, and how much water is available. These effects vary by region and can harm the health of people and ecosystems. For example, rising temperatures, drought, and reduced snowfall are putting more pressure on water supplies in the Southwest. In contrast, the Northeast and Southeast may experience more extreme storms and heavy rains, which can put aging water infrastructure (such as dams, sewers, and water treatment facilities) at risk.. To help reduce climate risks, many water utilities are considering potential impacts to their systems and taking steps to build resilience. Government agencies are supporting many resilience projects specifically focused on water resources. Individuals can also take steps to use water efficiently and help keep water bodies clean.. Explore the sections on this page to learn more about climate impacts on water resources:. The Earth includes both marine and freshwater regions. Marine regions, like the ocean and estuariesExit EPA’s website, have more salt than freshwaters like lakes, rivers, streams, and ponds. Most plants and animals can survive in only one type of water.. Climate change may disrupt the stability of water resources at local, regional, and national scales. Three key impacts are described in this section.. In many areas of the country, climate change is likely to increase people’s demand for water while also shrinking water supplies. In mountainous and cold-weather regions, many people depend on snowpack for drinking water, agriculture, and other uses. “Snowpack” refers to the layers of snow that accumulate over long periods of cold weather. As it melts, snowpack feeds into streams and becomes an important freshwater resource.. In the West, warmer temperatures and changes in precipitation are reducing snowpack. In some areas, less snow is falling, as more precipitation is falling as rain rather than snow., 5 Higher temperatures are also causing snowpack to melt earlier. All of these changes affect when and how much water is available.. Photo caption endnote:7. Even without the impacts of climate change, the United States’ water supply has begun to diminish. Much of our water supply comes from groundwater held in underground formations called aquifersExit EPA’s website. In some parts of the nation, increased demand for water has led to pumping groundwater from aquifers faster than they can be naturally refilled. Persistent droughts in some areas are accelerating this decline. Warming temperatures from climate change may increase the chance of droughts, especially in the West.. Climate change is expected to harm water quality. For example, increased rainfall can lead to more runoff of sediments, nutrients, pathogens, and other substances into water bodies. Increases in nutrient runoff, along with warming water temperatures, can also lead to harmful algal blooms. These algal blooms can kill fish, shellfish, and other animals. They can also make drinking and recreational water sources unsafe for people and pets.. Climate change threatens to increase the salinity of water bodies and groundwater through saltwater intrusion. Rising sea level and increased drought can enable saline water to advance farther upstream and inland in estuaries, wetlands, and aquifers. Higher salinity can contaminate freshwater supplies and harm aquatic plants and animals. These impacts are especially likely to happen in low-lying areas such as Louisiana, Florida, and portions of California and the mid-Atlantic.. As much of the U.S. water infrastructure nears the end of its planned life, climate change impacts, such as more extreme weather events, will further strain its ability to operate well. Heavy rainfall events can cause dams and levees to fail. In addition, climate impacts on other parts of society may have indirect effects on water utilities. For example, storms that damage power generation or distribution might shut down water and wastewater plants. In other cases, there may be competing needs from surface reservoirs, which face demands as a drinking water supply as well as a source for generating electricity.. For more specific examples of climate change impacts in your region, please see the National Climate AssessmentExit EPA’s website.. The United States uses water to grow crops, raise livestock, produce energy, manufacture and distribute goods, and support many other parts of the economy. Nationwide, healthy watersheds also provide millions of jobs as well as revenues in tourism, recreation, fishing, and other industries.. In addition, watersheds provide a host of ecosystem services. These beneficial services are the free work that communities do not have to do, or pay for, themselves. While it can be hard to put a dollar value on these services, they provide tremendous benefits to society. Among these benefits are water filtration and storage, soil formation, carbon storage, flood control, erosion control, and recreation. Watersheds also function as critical wildlife corridorsExit EPA’s website, providing passage for animals during their life cycles.. Clean water is also essential to human health. Water utilities spend more than $109 billion each year to provide safe drinking water and wastewater services in the communities they serve. Nonetheless, more than 7 million people get sick from diseases spread through water each year. These illnesses cost the U.S. health care system more than $3 billion annually, and climate impacts are expected to increase risk of exposure to water-borne pathogens and water-treatment expenses., 20, 21. Certain groups of people in the United States, including Indigenous communities, low-income communities, communities on the U.S.–Mexico border, migrant farm workers, and others lack access to clean water and sanitation services. Climate impacts will compound this situation.. For example, many rural residents currently depend on community or private wells where water is treated minimally or not at all. Some small and rural water utilities also struggle to provide safe and affordable drinking water and wastewater services. Barriers to providing these services can include limited resources, extreme climate, or remote locations.. Many Indigenous communities\\xa0lack access to water for drinking, agriculture, fisheries, and other uses. Climate stressors can worsen this problem. For example, decreasing snowpack, decreasing streamflow, and warmer water temperatures are harming salmon populations in the Northwest. Salmon loss affects Indigenous peoples’ economies and cultural identities. In Alaska, traditional hunting and subsistence practices have been disrupted by ice melting due to rising temperatures.. Outside of some U.S.–Mexico border cities, unincorporated communities called “colonias” lack both water and wastewater services. Some border cities also face stormwater and pollutant runoff problems. These areas are often prone to flooding and increases in heavy rains caused by climate change are expected to worsen.. Learn more about some of the key indicators of climate change related to this sector from EPA’s Climate Change Indicators:. We can reduce climate change’s impact on water resources in many ways, including the following:. The U.S. energy system consists of all the infrastructure needed to collect, produce, distribute, store, and consume power for our homes, for our businesses, and while we are on the go. From manufacturing to agriculture, and health care to transportation, the nation depends on a stable energy supply.\\xa0. Our energy system is vulnerable to a wide range of climate change impacts. These include rising temperatures and heat waves, cold and snow events, severe drought, intense rainfall, sea level rise, hurricanes, and wildfires. While these impacts differ from one region to another, they will continue to affect all areas of the country. Moreover, impacts to one part of the energy system or in one region can affect other parts of the system or other areas.. Hurricanes and extreme weather threats. Storm surge from hurricanes already threaten dozens of power plants and refineries on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. Rising sea levels will expose even more facilities to risk during extreme weather events.. Wildfires. Warmer, drier conditions caused by climate change are expected to make wildfires more frequent and intense. When a tree came in contact with electrical distribution lines, it sparked the largest wildfire in California’s history, the 2021 Dixie Fire.. Damage to Alaska infrastructure. Sea level rise, melting sea ice, and thawing permafrost are all expected to damage oil and gas infrastructure in Alaska, affecting energy production.. Nuclear energy impacts. Nuclear power accounts for about one-fifth of U.S. electricity production. Many nuclear reactors use water from freshwater bodies or oceans to cool down. Rising water and air temperatures have already forced some nuclear plants to temporarily close to lower the risk of overheating.. Reductions in hydropower. Drought, reduced mountain snowpack, and shifting snowmelt timing could affect hydropower energy production in the West, especially in summer, when demand is greatest.. Hurricanes and extreme weather threats. Storm surge from hurricanes already threaten dozens of power plants and refineries on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. Rising sea levels will expose even more facilities to risk during extreme weather events.. Wildfires. Warmer, drier conditions caused by climate change are expected to make wildfires more frequent and intense. When a tree came in contact with electrical distribution lines, it sparked the largest wildfire in California’s history, the 2021 Dixie Fire.. The energy sector is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. In turn, changes in climate can disrupt energy networks themselves, stress infrastructure, and pose safety risks to people. Read more about greenhouse gas emissions on the Basics of Climate Change page.\\xa0. In addition, energy interacts with and depends on other sectors of the economy, such as water resources\\xa0and transportation. Therefore, climate impacts on these sectors can affect the energy system.. Businesses, governments, and others are taking many actions to increase the resiliency of the energy system to climate change. For example, many states are upgrading and protecting their energy infrastructure from extreme weather. Governments and businesses are sharing information with each other through private/public partnerships. Companies and researchers are developing and installing innovative and renewable technologies (such as wind and solar) that help reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. These actions not only help address vulnerabilities to the energy system, but also reduce the emissions that are making climate change worse.. Learn more about climate impacts on the energy sector:. Climate change may affect the energy sector at both local and regional scales. Four key impacts are described in this section.. Extreme weather and natural disasters pose significant risks to the U.S. energy supply in all regions of the country. Energy systems on both the Gulf and East Coasts face more risk of damage from flooding due to hurricanes and sea level rise. More frequent and intense precipitation events are expected to increase the risk of flooding on infrastructure in the Northeast and the Midwest. In Arctic regions like Alaska, thawing permafrost causes land to sink and compromise fuel pipelines and other energy infrastructure.. Overall, the climate is warming, and the atmosphere’s increasing capacity to hold moisture can lead to longer periods without rainfall. The warmth and variability in precipitation can lead to declining snowpack, shifts in snowmelt, and extended droughts—all of which affect water supplies needed for energy systems. For example, most U.S. power plants depend on rivers or lakes for cooling. Petroleum, natural gas, and biofuels production and refining also require a steady supply of water. Water shortages have already affected hydropower production, especially in the West. Without enough water, affected systems need to find new water sources or scale back their operations.\\xa0. Climate change threatens the ways in which power reaches our homes and businesses. For example, transmission lines are prone to damage during extreme weather. Snow and ice, wildfires, and extreme wind can damage above-ground powerlines and transmission towers. Flooding can affect underground powerlines and damage roads, railroads, pipelines, and storage facilities. Near the coast, storm surge can destroy petroleum storage tanks and wash out roads and railways.. Warmer temperatures, especially hot summer temperatures, can affect power transmission. When temperatures rise, the carrying capacity of transmission lines decreases. Summer months also present more wildfire risks, especially in the Southwest. Wildfires can disrupt energy networks significantly when they affect transmission towers and powerlines.,17 In some areas, faulty or fallen powerlines (or lines that come in contact with trees) can start wildfires. This risk is why some utilities shut down powerlines when high winds are forecast.. Temperatures are rising in all regions of the United States. As the climate warms, Americans are expected to use more energy, mostly electricity, for cooling. This higher demand will also increase the chance of blackouts or other power disruptions.. A warming climate also means that Americans are expected to use less energy for heating their homes in the winter. However, increased summer demands for cooling are expected to outweigh any energy-use reductions from lower heating needs.. As the demand for cooling increases across the nation, more electricity must be produced to meet this demand. Increasing energy production is likely to increase emissions of certain air pollutants and greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.,25. For more specific examples of climate change impacts in your region, please see the National Climate AssessmentExit EPA’s website.. An affordable and reliable energy supply is critical to the country’s economy. In 2020, the U.S. produced nearly 96 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu) of energy and consumed nearly 93 quadrillion Btu. Energy produced in the United States, but not consumed here, is exported to other countries. Fossil fuels (petroleum, coal, and natural gas) accounted for nearly 80% of U.S. energy production—both electricity generation and energy consumed directly—in 2020. The primary consumer sectors of energy in the United States are the industrial, transportation, commercial, and residential sectors.. The energy system is an important source of employment for Americans, providing jobs for about 5. million people. These jobs support power generation and transmission, fuel extraction and processing, and renewable energy and energy-efficiency installations and sales.. U.S. energy exports also contribute to the economy. In 2020, U.S. energy exports exceeded total energy imports, as the United States was a net exporter of petroleum products, natural gas, and coal. Crude oil was the only major fuel type for which the United States was a net importer.. Major disturbances to the energy supply, such as power outages or fuel shortages, harm the economy. For example, energy disruptions from extreme weather damage to energy infrastructure have cost billions of dollars. The nation’s energy system is also aging, with many components not designed to withstand the extreme weather conditions projected for this century.. Some communities have been historically overburdened by pollution. Low-income people, people of color, and linguistically isolated communities are more likely than the national average to live near power plants that burn fossil fuels. This means they can be exposed to air pollutants that cause or contribute to health issues, such as respiratory and heart diseases. As the climate changes and energy demand grows, communities may face increased levels of these emissions and associated risks.. Lower-income communities also carry a higher energy burden than those with higher incomes. On average, low-income households spend 8.% of their income on energy expenses. In comparison, non-low-income households spend 3%. Many factors contribute to this burden. For example, low-income households may live in housing without insulation or with outdated appliances. This energy burden may increase as the climate changes and energy demand goes up.. In addition, low-income communities often face barriers to accessing clean technologies that make energy more affordable. For instance, as of 2018, less than half of community-scale solar projects included households with lower incomes.. We can reduce climate change’s impact on the energy sector in many ways, including the following:. See additional actions you can take, as well as steps that companies can take, on EPA’s What You Can Do About Climate Change page.. Ecosystems are communities of living things, including plants, animals, and microorganisms, that interact with each other and the physical world. People depend on ecosystems for many benefits, such as food, water, clean air, building materials, and recreation. Ecosystems can be big, like the one that surrounds Yellowstone National Park,2 or as small as a single fallen tree. They can also overlap with one another or be part of larger ecosystems. These connections between ecosystems also make them dependent on one another, and not simply dependent on the organisms within them.. Climate change affects ecosystems in many ways. Climate controls how plants grow, how animals behave, which organisms thrive, and how they all interact with the physical environment.,4 As habitats experience different temperatures, precipitation patterns, and other changes, the organisms that make up ecosystems feel the effects. All U.S. regions are experiencing the impacts of climate change but impacts vary by area and ecosystem.. Reduced ecosystem services: lumber. Ecosystems provide Americans with needed materials such as wood. Changing precipitation patterns can influence the frequency and severity of wildfires, threatening this ecosystem service and important economic sector.. Impacts on populations\\' ability to survive. The white coat of the snowshoe hare makes it less visible to predators in the winter. But earlier snowmelts are making the hare stand out more against the brown forest floor, increasing its vulnerability.. Increased spread of invasive species. Cheatgrass is an invasive species that threatens ranches in the western United States. It degrades soil nutrients and can lead to a loss of biodiversity.. Changes in the timing of natural events. In Alaska, brown bears are switching their diet from salmon to elderberries as the berries ripen earlier due to a warming climate. When bears eat less salmon, it also affects other animals in the food web, like birds that feed on the salmon carcasses bears leave behind.. Reduced ecosystem services: erosion control. Salt marsh grasses help hold soil in place. In some areas, a change to the species balance, possibly due to changing temperatures, has allowed a grass-eating marsh crab to dominate, resulting in less grass to control erosion.. Reduced ecosystem services: lumber. Ecosystems provide Americans with needed materials such as wood. Changing precipitation patterns can influence the frequency and severity of wildfires, threatening this ecosystem service and important economic sector.. Impacts on populations\\' ability to survive. The white coat of the snowshoe hare makes it less visible to predators in the winter. But earlier snowmelts are making the hare stand out more against the brown forest floor, increasing its vulnerability.. People are taking many actions to help ecosystems adapt to climate change impacts or minimize the effects. For example, federal agencies that manage the nation’s natural resources are now considering climate change in polices and planning. At the local level, many groups are preserving habitats and restoring ecosystems that have been damaged or disturbed in the past.. Explore the sections on this page to learn more about climate impacts on ecosystems:. Ecosystems provide many benefits to people. These are called ecosystem services. Ecosystem services include goods from plants and animals, such as the food and wood provided by trees. They also include parts of the physical world that keep the planet safe and healthy. For example, clean lakes and streams are considered ecosystem services because we use them for drinking water and recreation.\\xa0. Climate change affects ecosystems at multiple levels, from the populations that make up ecosystems to the services they provide to communities, economies, and people. Four key impacts are described in this section.. As the climate changes, some species will adapt by changing their behavior, physical characteristics, or how their bodies function. Others will not be able to adapt. As a result, climate change could lead to expansions, reductions, or extinctions of some populations. These changes, in turn, can affect the overall biodiversity of a region.. Plants and animals may also change the geographic range they inhabit in response to changing climatic conditions. Changing temperature and water conditions have already altered the ranges of many plants and animals. As temperatures have warmed in the United States, some land animals have moved to the (typically cooler) north by an average of 3. miles per decade. Some marine species have also shifted north by more than 17 miles per decade.. Many plants and animals rely on cues in nature, including temperature and water conditions, to trigger certain stages of their life cycles. As the climate changes, these cues can change at different rates, or potentially not all. As a result, species that depend on one another at certain times of the year may no longer be in sync.\\xa0. For example, plankton are an important food source for young fish, but they tend to react more quickly to changes in temperature than the fish. This means the plankton might not be as available when growing fish need it most. Also, if a bird migrates at the same time each year, it could reach its destination to find that, due to shifting temperatures, its main food source grew too early and is no longer available.. Climate change is also changing the way species and populations interact with the environment and one another. These impacts can be felt throughout an entire ecosystem.. For example, climate change is increasing the spread of invasive speciesExit EPA’s website in some areas. An invasive species is one that is not native to an area. Invasive species can outcompete native plants and animals, bring in new diseases, and cause other problems. These changes can create significant environmental and economic harm.. As ocean water warms, invasive fish species, such as the tropical lionfishExit EPA’s website, are expected to move north along the Atlantic coast, threatening native species. This can also hurt humans, as lionfish are venomous and can sting people.. Climate change can also affect food webs. A food web is the whole set of feeding relationships among different organisms in an ecosystem. At the bottom of a food web are organisms like plants and plankton. Other animals, higher in the web, rely on them as food sources. Climate impacts on any part of a food web can affect the whole system, and even other ecosystems altogether. From the example above, if young fish cannot find enough food in the estuaries, their predators in the ocean could feel the effects as well.\\xa0. Climate change is affecting some of the critical services that ecosystems provide to society. For example, ecosystems provide a bounty of food to people. Climate changes, like drought and heat, could affect the availability and quality of some foods, as well as farmers’ ability to grow certain crops.. Climate change can also affect ecosystem services such as carbon capture and storage. Forest ecosystems play a critical role in the carbon cycle, helping to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in roots, soil, and the forest floor. But climate-driven increases in wildfires, flooding, pests, and diseases can limit the ability of an ecosystem to provide this important service.. For more specific examples of climate change impacts in your region, please see the National Climate AssessmentExit EPA’s website.. Ecosystems and their benefits—often referred to as ecosystem services—support key aspects of human existence. As a result, they are the foundation to large parts of the economy. Globally, ecosystem services are worth an estimated $125 to $145 trillion per year.. Climate change impacts affect the livelihoods of millions of Americans, including fishers, loggers, ranchers, and farmers. For example, the stress caused by rising water temperatures and ocean acidification could cost the shellfish industry hundreds of millions of dollars. Shifting ranges for certain fish mean that fishers may need to travel farther to catch them or purchase new equipment to reach those areas. These shifts are projected to result in losses of hundreds of millions of dollars each year by the year 2100. U.S. agriculture will also experience economic impacts, though they could be both negative and positive. Climate change threatens to bring increased droughts, pests, and extreme weather events, which would take an economic toll. However, earlier springs and milder winter weather can prolong growing seasons in many regions, increasing crop yields and revenues.\\xa0\\xa0. Climate change also affects the tourism and recreation industries. Harmful algal blooms already cost the country nearly $1 billion each year from the loss of recreational fishing and boating revenue. Damage to coral reefs due to climate change is projected to result in $140 billion in total lost revenues to the U.S. recreation industry by 2100. Communities that depend on tourism will feel these economic impacts the most.. Some communities depend on ecosystems and their services more than others, including some Indigenous and rural communities. As ecosystems change, some groups also may be able to adapt better than others due to geographic, social, or economic factors.. Indigenous communities have a unique relationship with the environment. Climate change impacts on ecosystems can harm Indigenous peoples’ ability to preserve and sustain their cultural heritage.,27 Shifting animal ranges can disrupt Indigenous peoples’ ability to hunt and fish as the animals move beyond their tribal lands.. Many rural communities depend on ecosystem-related livelihoods, including farming, fishing, and raising livestock. People in these areas are more likely to see economic impacts when faced with ecosystem challenges, such as invasive species and decreased soil quality.. We can limit climate change’s impacts on ecosystems in several ways, including the following:. Learn more about some of the key indicators of climate change related to this sector from EPA’s Climate Change Indicators in the United States:. U.S. coasts span the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic oceans as well as the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. When including the coast of the Great Lakes, more than 128 million people live in coastal counties. Coastal ecosystems support many industries, provide recreational opportunities, and protect communities from storms. Coasts are also important to global trade and in providing job opportunities.. Land losses. Roughly 20 square miles of dry land and wetland became open water along the Atlantic coast between 1996 and 2011. (As a comparison, the Manhattan Island is 33 square miles.)37. Damaged or lost coastal property. By 2050, up to $106 billion worth of coastal property will likely be below sea level if current trends continue.. More intense rains. Heavy rainfalls associated with hurricanes increase as the climate warms. In 2018, Hurricane Florence produced record rainfall levels in North Carolina, causing catastrophic flooding in some areas.. More tidal flooding days. Tidal flooding is increasing in some areas as sea levels rise. Some communities, including Boston, Houston, and Orlando, are seeing twice as many tidal flooding days each year as they did 20 years ago.. Impacts to coastal ecosystems. Climate-driven changes can affect the feeding, breeding, and resting places for many wildlife species. For example, saltmarsh sparrows are declining on the East Coast due to increased flooding from rising seas and more extreme storms.. Land losses. Roughly 20 square miles of dry land and wetland became open water along the Atlantic coast between 1996 and 2011. (As a comparison, the Manhattan Island is 33 square miles.)37. Damaged or lost coastal property. By 2050, up to $106 billion worth of coastal property will likely be below sea level if current trends continue.. U.S. coastal counties face permanent inundation and flooding threats from sea level rise, intense rains, high tide flooding, and severe storms. It is likely that hurricane intensity has also increased over the past four decades. Scientists project that as the climate warms, there will be more intense hurricanes as well as increased rainfall. Although there is uncertainty about where, when, and how much sea level will rise, scientists are highly confident there will be significant impacts on coastal communities even at lower-end estimates. Other climate threats to coasts include ocean acidification, harmful algal blooms, and saltwater intrusion.. Many communities are taking steps to protect coasts from climate change. For example, some communities are elevating buildings or constructing barriers to shield people, businesses, and property from flooding and storm surge.,6 Others are restoring coastal habitats and using nature-based features to build coastal resilience. Many coastal cities and counties are focusing on land use planning to encourage smart growth and reduce the impacts of climate change. Yet, elsewhere, communities are relocating entirely; members of the Isle de Jean Charles Band of the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Tribe are planning to resettle inland after losing 98% of their tribal lands to rising seas., 8. Explore the sections on this page to learn more about climate impacts on coasts:. The effects of climate change on the nation’s coasts have been observed for decades. Three key impacts of climate change are described in this section.. A growing concentration of people live in the nation’s coastal areas. In fact, while coastal counties make up only 10% of the nation’s land mass (excluding Alaska), they are home to 40% of the population. Climate change impacts to coastal communities affect not only human health, but also properties, infrastructure, and services.. More than $1 trillion worth of property is located within 700 feet of the coast. These properties’ proximity to water bodies may put them at risk of extreme weather events, hurricanes, sea level rise, and high tide flooding. These threats can damage or destroy property or make real estate uninhabitable. In turn, property losses potentially affect local economies by shuttering brick-and-mortar businesses, lowering tax revenues, and diverting resources from public services. Losing a home or business may also cause mental health impacts, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder.. In addition to homes and businesses, critical coastal infrastructure is also at risk. The nation’s coasts are home to many military bases, airports, power plants, oil refining facilities, and other infrastructure. More than 60,000 miles of roads and bridges are located in U.S. coastal floodplains. Increased flooding of roads and bridges can delay or disrupt transportation, affecting peoples’ everyday routines, including their ability get to work or school, obtain food and supplies, and receive medical care. Increased flooding can also affect emergency preparedness and response efforts.. The nation’s coasts include a wide range of ecosystems, such as estuaries, deltas, mangroves, marshes, beaches, and reefs. These ecosystems provide recreational opportunities and support tourism, fishing, and many other industries. They also are home to diverse species of wildlife. In addition, healthy coastal watersheds provide other benefits to society, such as improving water quality and storing carbon.. Some coastal ecosystems are already affected by rising temperatures, sea level rise, and extreme weather events. In addition, in a number of places nationwide, there are large dead zonesExit EPA’s website where marine life cannot live. In these areas, nutrient runoff indirectly causes low oxygen levels in the water. As a result, these vast stretches of open water experience die-offs of fish, shellfish, corals, and aquatic plants. These zones are expected to increase in number and size as the ocean warms and heavier rains wash more nutrient-laden runoff into coastal waters.. Climate change can also contribute to saltwater intrusion. Rising sea level and increased drought can enable saline water to advance further upstream and inland in estuaries, wetlands, and aquifers. Higher salinity can contaminate freshwater supplies and threaten some aquatic plants and animals.. In addition, rising sea levels and more extreme weather can increase the extent to which storm surge and high tides can cause saltwater to infiltrate low-lying areas and groundwater, which harms agriculture or drinking water supplies.. Climate change is contributing to coastal land losses, especially on the Gulf Coast. Rising sea levels can turn dry land into wetlands or open water. Existing wetlands can also be at risk. From 1932 to 2016, Louisiana lost more than 2,000 square miles of land area, mostly wetlands, in part due to rising sea levels.. The loss of coastal land can have a direct impact on both the immediate environment and surrounding communities. Coastal wetlands in particular play an important role in providing habitats for fish and birds and in attenuating coastal storm impacts. As a carbon sink, wetlands help mitigate climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. When wetlands are lost, their ability to store carbon is also reduced. In addition, wetlands defend communities from erosion, waves, flooding, and storm surge.. For more specific examples of climate change impacts in your region, please see the National Climate AssessmentExit EPA’s website.. . The nation’s coasts are essential to local, national, and global economies. Coastal counties produce more than $9. trillion in goods and services each year. Communities on the coasts also support more than 58 million jobs in the fishing, tourism, real estate, defense, and other industries.. Most of the goods in our stores arrive through the nation’s marine transportation system. In fact, more than three-fourths of all trade involves marine transportation.. Damage to the coasts, such as from hurricanes and flooding, has negative impacts on the economy. In addition to property damage and cleanup costs, interruptions can occur in business operations and community services. Disruptions can also extend far beyond an affected area to transportation routes, energy distribution, and supply chains. Hurricane Katrina is the costliest hurricane on record, incurring damages totaling $182. billion in 2021 dollars.\\xa0. Climate change is expected to worsen existing inequities affecting socially vulnerable populations\\xa0in coastal areas. These underserved populations span many regions and groups, from the elderly in Florida to rural coastal communities to Indigenous fishing communities of Alaska. Extreme weather events have highlighted how some of these groups face heightened risks as the climate changes. For example, a disproportionate number of flood-related deaths from Hurricane Katrina were older adults.. Not everyone will be able to prepare for or respond equally to climate change threats in coastal areas. Climate impacts may force people to elevate their homes or move. However, some people may not be able to afford to improve their homes and may be forced to move. Others may be unwilling or unable to move and may endure increasing damages. Renters, low-income households, those who face language barriers, and others may find it difficult to voice their opinions or take immediate action to preserve their home or community. In some areas, protective infrastructure might be prioritized for higher-density areas at the expense of leaving rural residents more exposed.. Many Indigenous peoples are among those coastal communities vulnerable to climate change, including those in the Southeast, the Pacific Islands, and the Northwest, as well as Alaska. Many Tribes are proactively planning for adaptation. In addition, some are using traditional knowledge to respond to changing environmental conditions. However, many Tribes face institutional and resource barriers that make adaptation challenging, such as limited access to their ancestral lands in vulnerable locations.. Organizations, communities, land managers, and others can take many actions to reduce the impacts of climate change on U.S. coasts, including the following:. Learn more about some of the key indicators of climate change related to this sector from EPA’s Climate Change Indicators:. The built environment includes structures and systems that provide places for people to live, work, and play. It includes buildings, roads, bridges, parks, streets, and systems that provide transportation, water, power, and more. These structures and systems exist in nearly all places where people live and work, but tend to be most concentrated in metropolitan areas. About 85% of Americans live in metropolitan areas, and that number is projected to grow over the next 100 years.. Reduced air quality. In the West, wildfires are on the rise, affecting air quality in nearby cities while also posing risks to people and property.. More urban flooding. Intense, single-day rainstorms are rising, increasing the risk of urban flooding, especially in areas with a lot of paved surfaces.. Increased heat impacts. Many cities already experience urban heat islands. Now, unusually hot summer days and nights are also becoming more common. Urban residents can face more heat illnesses, power outages, and higher energy prices as a result.. Increased property damage. Charleston, South Carolina, is at risk for coastal flooding and sea level rise, both of which can cause damage to historic buildings and landmarks. The city is elevating some buildings to protect them from climate change.. Reduced air quality. In the West, wildfires are on the rise, affecting air quality in nearby cities while also posing risks to people and property.. More urban flooding. Intense, single-day rainstorms are rising, increasing the risk of urban flooding, especially in areas with a lot of paved surfaces.. Climate change affects cities differently depending on their location. Many cities are already dealing with multiple impacts from climate change. For example, some experience more frequent and longer heat waves. Those impacts worsen the temperature problems caused by urban heat islands—that is, city areas with higher temperatures than outlying areas. At the same time, some urban areas are experiencing repeated flooding from heavy rains that overwhelm drainage systems. Others face flooding problems due to losses of wetlands and forests that once absorbed rainfall.. In addition, the built environment interacts with and depends on other sectors of the economy, such as water, transportation, and energy . So, climate impacts on these sectors can also affect the built environment.. Cities are taking steps to adapt to climate change. These actions are helping to protect the built environment, improve land-use planning, and increase emergency preparedness. For example, many cities are planting trees, installing green roofs, and adding green spaces. These measures help improve air quality and cool urban areas. More permeable ground cover also absorbs rainfall, reducing runoff and flooding. Some governments are using policy measures, like building codes and zoning laws, to protect the built environment and city residents from climate change.. Explore the sections on this page to learn more about climate impacts on the built environment:. Even though cities only occupy about 1% to 5% of the land in North America, they produce 80 percent of all the greenhouse gases on the continent. Read more about greenhouse gas emissions on the Basics of Climate Change page.. Climate change has multiple effects on the built environment. Three key impacts are described in this section.. A lot of U.S. infrastructure is nearing the end of its life. This aging infrastructure is threatened by extreme weather events—some of which are already becoming more frequent and/or more intense.. Climate change impacts on infrastructure vary by region. For example, in coastal regions, high tide flooding has harmed or destroyed infrastructure and private property. In the West, wildfires are already damaging property and affecting air quality. In floodplains across the nation, extreme precipitation can cause dam failures, bridge washouts, and road closures. Many cities also have outdated or aging sewer systems that intense rainfall can overwhelm, causing untreated wastewater to flow into local water bodies.. Extreme temperatures can also stress the U.S. energy system. Failing cooling systems can lead to high indoor temperatures that endanger workers\\' health\\xa0and reduce productivity. Transportation systems are also vulnerable to multiple climate change stressors, including extreme temperatures and heavy precipitation. For example, flooding from extreme precipitation can cause billions of dollars of damage to transportation infrastructure in a single year. Meanwhile, high temperatures can stress bridge integrity and weaken rail systems.. Urban centers produce many goods that are important to the economy at local to global scales. Cities also provide many essential services to the public, such as telecommunications, energy, water, health care, and transportation.. A network of interconnected systems supports the flow of these goods and services. Climate change poses multiple and far-reaching risks to these systems. For example, extreme weather can cause power outages that disrupt transportation, interrupt supply chains, limit communication, and make it difficult for people to access health care.. Cities provide access to jobs, education, recreation, arts, culture, and much more. But many cities already face challenges with aging infrastructure, social inequities, and other problems. Climate change can worsen these problems and pose additional risks. For example, climate impacts on air quality and water quality\\xa0can affect people’s health. Flooding can force people to evacuate their homes, affecting their mental and physical health. Sea level rise, flooding, and wildfires also threaten some historic landmarks, playgrounds, and cultural sites.\\xa0. Forests, open spaces, and waterways in urban areas provide a wide range of benefits, but many are stressed due to development, pollution, and invasive species. These existing challenges can reduce their resilience to climate change effects.. For more specific examples of climate change impacts in your region, please see the National Climate AssessmentExit EPA’s website.. Urban areas are important engines of economic growth—hubs for producing and consuming goods and services. In 2015, urban areas contributed about 91% of the United States’ gross domestic product (GDP). The five largest cities in the country accounted for 23% of the GDP. In addition, urban lands are worth trillions of dollars.. However, cities also bear the burden of aging and declining infrastructure that needs major financial investments to replace or repair. Not addressing this problem could cost the U.S. GDP up to $3. trillion by 2025. This estimate considers reduced goods production, lost trade, disrupted supply chains, fewer jobs, and lower wages. Services like transportation, water, electricity, and sanitation would also be affected, impacting people’s health and quality of life. . Some groups of urban residents are especially vulnerable to climate change impacts on the built environment. For example, children, older adults, outdoor workers, and people with some medical conditions are all sensitive to extreme heat. The urban heat island effect in built-up areas will intensify the effects of extreme heat events and reduce the relief provided by cooler temperatures at night. People who lack housing or who live in homes without adequate insulation or cooling are also more at risk for heat stress.. In addition, many groups of urban residents live with high levels of air pollution.,28 Black and African American individuals are 34% more likely to live in areas with the highest projected increases in childhood asthma due to climate-related changes in particulate matter.. People who live in buildings that are older or in poor condition can be more exposed to outdoor pollutants and allergens. These buildings may also sustain more damage during extreme weather, such as storms and floods. This can lead to damp indoor environments prone to mold and bacteria.. Climate change can also affect food security in urban areas. For example, power outages from extreme weather can cause food spoilage. Climate impacts on agriculture and transportation may affect supply chains, food prices, and availability. People who already have limited access to food will be affected the most. These include households with an income below the poverty threshold, those headed by a single woman, and those with Black or Hispanic owners or lessees. . We can reduce the impact of climate change on the built environment in many ways, including the following:. See additional actions you can take, as well as steps that companies can take, on EPA’s What You Can Do About Climate Change page.. Learn more about some of the key indicators of climate change related to this sector from EPA’s Climate Change Indicators in the United States:. Clean air is critical to human health. It is also important for the health of vegetation and crops. It contributes to people’s enjoyment of scenic areas, like national parks and wilderness areas.. The effects of climate change on air quality will continue to vary by region. In many areas of the United States, climate change is expected to worsen harmful ground-level ozone, increase people’s exposure to allergens like pollen, and contribute to worsening air quality. It can also decrease visibility so that it is harder to see into the distance. Changes in the amount of outdoor air pollutants can also affect indoor air quality.. Increased pollen. Rising temperatures and higher carbon dioxide concentrations related to climate change can lengthen the pollen season and increase the amount of pollen produced by plants.. Increased ozone. The 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 2005, with record highs across the globe in 2020. Temperatures are expected to continue rising, and hot, sunny days can increase the amount of ozone at ground level.. Increased Particulate Matter. In 2021, the U.S. Southwest experienced one of the most severe long-term droughts of the past 1,200 years. Dust from droughts can increase particulate matter and cause air quality issues.. Increased indoor pollutants. Extreme weather, such as flooding and storm surge, can damage buildings and allow water or moisture inside. Damp indoor conditions can lead to the growth of harmful pollutants, such as mold and bacteria.. Increased wildfires. In 2020, wildfires burned over 10 million acres of land in the United States, the highest-ever amount on record. Wildfire smoke lowers air quality and harms human health.. Increased pollen. Rising temperatures and higher carbon dioxide concentrations related to climate change can lengthen the pollen season and increase the amount of pollen produced by plants.. Increased ozone. The 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 2005, with record highs across the globe in 2020. Temperatures are expected to continue rising, and hot, sunny days can increase the amount of ozone at ground level.. Climate impacts on air quality will depend on what additional measures are taken to reduce air pollution. Regulatory initiatives, partnership programs, and individual actions can all help reduce air pollutants that harm human health, as well as greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.. Explore the sections on this page to learn more about climate impacts on air quality:. Climate change can affect air quality, and certain air pollutants can affect climate change. For example, hot sunny days associated with a warming climate can increase ground-level ozone in some areas. Ground-level ozone is also a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change by trapping heat in the atmosphere. Read more about greenhouse gases and the climate effects of certain air pollutants on the\\xa0Basics of Climate Change\\xa0page.. Climate change may affect air quality at both local and regional scales. Three key impacts are described in this section.. More than 100 million people in the United States live in areas with poor air quality. In many regions of the United States, climate-driven changes in weather conditions, including temperature and precipitation, are expected to increase ground-level ozone and particulate matter (such as windblown dust from droughts or smoke from wildfires). These changes worsen existing air pollution. Exposure to these pollutants can lead to or worsen health problems, such as respiratory and heart diseases.. Climate change can also affect indoor air quality. Increases in outside air pollutants, such as ozone and particulate matter, could lead to higher indoor exposures. These pollutants can enter a building in many ways, including through open doors and windows and ventilation systems.. Mold, dust mites, bacteria, and other indoor pollutants may increase as climate change-related precipitation and storms increase. For example, flood damage can create a damp indoor environment, leading to mold growth. Indoor air pollutants have been linked to heart disease, respiratory diseases such as asthma, and cancer.. Air pollution may also damage crops, plants, and forests. For example, when plants absorb large amounts of ground-level ozone, they experience reduced photosynthesis, slower growth, and higher sensitivity to diseases.. Climate change has already led to more frequent wildfires and a longer wildfire season. Wildfire smoke pollutes the air, impairing visibility and disrupting outdoor activities. It can also spread hundreds of miles downwind to other regions.. Exposure to wildfire smoke can worsen respiratory illnesses, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and bronchitis. Wildfire smoke exposures have also been linked to premature births.. A changing climate is expected to cause earlier and longer springs and summers, warmer temperatures, precipitation changes, and higher carbon dioxide concentrations. All of these changes can increase people’s exposure to pollen and other airborne allergens, which in turn can lead to more allergy-related illnesses, such as asthma and hay fever.. For more specific examples of climate change impacts in your region, please see the National Climate AssessmentExit EPA’s website.. Cleaner air is closely linked to a healthy economy. For example, good air quality improves Americans’ health and productivity. In 2020 alone, reductions in air pollution prevented more than 230,000 premature deaths, 200,000 heart attacks, 120,000 emergency room visits, and 17 million lost workdays. Working toward cleaner air also creates jobs, advances technologies, and produces billions of dollars for the United States in revenues and exported goods and services.\\xa0. Many socially vulnerable groups live in industrial or urban areas with high levels of air pollution.,18\\xa0In fact, Black and African Americans individuals are 34% more likely than non-Blacks to live in areas with the highest projected increases in childhood asthma due to climate-related changes in particulate matter. Some people are also more vulnerable to the health impacts of air pollution because they have chronic medical conditions. For example, certain communities of color, low-income groups, Indigenous populations, and immigrant groups have higher rates of heart disease, asthma, and COPD.,21. Certain populations may also be more vulnerable to air quality impacts because they work outside. For example, farm workers, firefighters, roofers, and construction workers are among those workers whom scientists expect will be affected by air quality impacts from climate change.\\xa0. Both rural and urban low-income populations may live in older buildings that are not well sealed, increasing their exposure to outdoor allergens and pollutants. Older buildings or buildings in poor condition may also take more damage during extreme weather, such as storms and floods. This can lead to damp indoor environments prone to mold, bacteria, and other indoor air contaminants.. We can reduce climate and air quality impacts in many ways, including the following:. Learn more about some of the key indicators of climate change related to this sector from EPA’s Climate Change Indicators in the United States:. There are over two million farms in the United States, and more than half the nation’s land is used for agricultural production. The number of farms has been slowly declining since the 1930s,2 though the average farm size has remained about the same since the early 1970s. Agriculture also extends beyond farms. It includes industries such as food service and food manufacturing.. Soil erosion. Heavy rainfalls can lead to more soil erosion, which is a major environmental threat to sustainable crop production.. Drought. Since early 2020, the U.S. Southwest has been experiencing one of the most severe long-term droughts of the past 1,200 years. Multiple seasons of record low precipitation and near-record high temperatures were the main triggers of the drought. 37. Wildfires. Some tribal communities are particularly vulnerable to wildfires due to their often-remote locations and lack of firefighting resources and staff. In addition, because wildfire smoke can travel long distances from the source fire, its effects can be far reaching, especially for people with certain medical conditions or who spend long periods of time outside.. Decreased crop yields. Rising temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations may increase some crop yields, but the yields of major commodity crops (such as corn, rice, and oats) are expected to be lower than they would in a future without climate change.. Heat stress. Dairy cows are especially sensitive to heat stress, which can affect their appetite and milk production. In 2010, heat stress lowered annual U.S. dairy production by an estimated $1. billion.. Soil erosion. Heavy rainfalls can lead to more soil erosion, which is a major environmental threat to sustainable crop production.. Drought. Since early 2020, the U.S. Southwest has been experiencing one of the most severe long-term droughts of the past 1,200 years. Multiple seasons of record low precipitation and near-record high temperatures were the main triggers of the drought. 37. Agriculture is very sensitive to weather and climate. It also relies heavily on land, water, and other natural resources that climate affects. While climate changes (such as in temperature, precipitation, and frost timing) could lengthen the growing season or allow different crops to be grown in some regions,6 it will also make agricultural practices more difficult in others.. The effects of climate change on agriculture will depend on the rate and severity of the change, as well as the degree to which farmers and ranchers can adapt. U.S. agriculture already has many practices in placeExit EPA’s website to adapt to a changing climate, including crop rotation and integrated pest management. A good deal of research is also under way to help prepare for a changing climate.. Learn more about climate change and agriculture:. Climate change can affect crops, livestock, soil and water resources, rural communities, and agricultural workers. However, the agriculture sector also emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere that contribute to climate change.\\xa0. Read more about greenhouse gas emissions on the Basics of Climate Change\\xa0page.. Learn how the agriculture sector is reducing methane emissions from livestock waste through the AgSTAR program. For a more technical look at emissions from the agriculture sector, take a look at EPA\\'s Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory chapter on agriculture activities in the United States.\\xa0. Climate change may affect agriculture at both local and regional scales. Key impacts are described in this section.. Climate change can make conditions better or worse for growing crops in different regions. For example, changes in temperature, rainfall, and frost-free days are leading to longer growing seasons in almost every state. A longer growing season can have both positive and negative impacts for raising food. Some farmers may be able to plant longer-maturing crops or more crop cycles altogether, while others may need to provide more irrigation over a longer, hotter growing season. Air pollution may also damage crops, plants, and forests. For example, when plants absorb large amounts of ground-level ozone, they experience reduced photosynthesis, slower growth, and higher sensitivity to diseases. . Climate change can also increase the threat of wildfires. Wildfires pose major risks to farmlands, grasslands, and rangelands. Temperature and precipitation changes will also very likely expand the occurrence and range of insects, weeds, and diseases. This could lead to a greater need for weed and pest control.\\xa0. Pollination is vital to more than 100 crops grown in the United States. Warmer temperatures and changing precipitation can affect when plants bloom and when pollinatorsExit EPA’s website, such as bees and butterflies, come out. If mismatches occur between when plants flower and when pollinators emerge, pollination could decrease.. Climate change is expected to increase the frequency of heavy precipitation in the United States, which can harm crops by eroding soil and depleting soil nutrients. Heavy rains can also increase agricultural runoff into oceans, lakes, and streams. This runoff can harm water quality.\\xa0. When coupled with warming water temperatures brought on by climate change, runoff can lead to depleted oxygen levels in water bodies. This is known as hypoxia. Hypoxia can kill fish and shellfish. It can also affect their ability to find food and habitat, which in turn could harm the coastal societies and economies that depend on those ecosystems.\\xa0. Sea level rise and storms also pose threats to coastal agricultural communities. These threats include erosion, agricultural land losses, and saltwater intrusion, which can contaminate water supplies. Climate change is expected to worsen these threats.\\xa0. Agricultural workers face several climate-related health risks. These include exposures to heat and other extreme weather, more pesticide exposure due to expanded pest presence, disease-carrying pests like mosquitos and ticks, and degraded air quality. Language barriers, lack of health care access, and other factors can compound these risks. Heat and humidity can also affect the health and productivity of animals raised for meat, milk, and eggs. . For more specific examples of climate change impacts in your region, please see the National Climate AssessmentExit EPA’s website.. Agriculture contributed more than $1. trillion to the U.S. gross domestic product in 2019. The sector accounts for 10. percent of total U.S. employment—more than 22 million jobs. These include not only on-farm jobs, but also jobs in food service and other related industries. Food service makes up the largest share of these jobs at 13 million. . Cattle, corn, dairy products, and soybeans are the top income-producing commoditiesExit EPA’s website. The United States is also a key exporter of soybeans, other plant products, tree nuts, animal feeds, beef, and veal.. Many hired crop farmworkersExit EPA’s website are foreign-born people from Mexico and Central America. Most hired crop farmworkers are not migrant workers; instead, they work at a single location within 75 miles of their homes. Many hired farmworkers can be more at risk of climate health threats due to social factors, such as language barriers and health care access.. Climate change could affect food security for some households in the country. Most U.S. households are currently food secureExit EPA’s website. This means that all people in the household have enough food to live active, healthy lives. However, 13. million U.S. households (about one-tenth of all U.S. households) were food insecure at least part of the time in 2020. U.S. households with above-average food insecurityExit EPA’s website include those with an income below the poverty threshold, those headed by a single woman, and those with Black or Hispanic owners and lessees.. Climate change can also affect food security for some Indigenous peoples in Hawai\\'i and other U.S.-affiliated Pacific islands. Climate impacts like sea level rise and more intense storms can affect the production of crops like taro, breadfruit, and mango. These crops are often key sources of nutrition and may also have cultural and economic importance.. We can reduce the impact of climate change on agriculture in many ways, including the following:. See additional actions you can take, as well as steps that companies can take, on EPA’s What You Can Do About Climate Change page.. Learn more about some of the key indicators of climate change related to this sector from EPA’s Climate Change Indicators:. . . Climate change presents a fundamental threat to human health. It affects the physical environment as well as all aspects of both natural and human systems – including social and economic conditions and the functioning of health systems. It is therefore a threat multiplier, undermining and potentially reversing decades of health progress. As climatic conditions change, more frequent and intensifying weather and climate events are observed, including storms, extreme heat, floods, droughts and wildfires. These weather and climate hazards affect health both directly and indirectly, increasing the risk of deaths, noncommunicable diseases, the emergence and spread of infectious diseases, and health emergencies. . Climate change is also having an impact on our health workforce and infrastructure, reducing capacity to provide universal health coverage (UHC). More fundamentally, climate shocks and growing stresses such as changing temperature and precipitation patterns, drought, floods and rising sea levels degrade the environmental and social determinants of physical and mental health. All aspects of health are affected by climate change, from clean air, water and soil to food systems and livelihoods. Further delay in tackling climate change will increase health risks, undermine decades of improvements in global health, and contravene our collective commitments to ensure the human right to health for all.. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\\'s (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) concluded that climate risks are appearing faster and will become more severe sooner than previously expected, and it will be harder to adapt with increased global heating.. It further reveals that 3.\\xa0billion people already live in areas highly susceptible to climate change. Despite contributing minimally to global emissions, low-income countries and small island developing states (SIDS) endure the harshest health impacts. In vulnerable regions, the death rate from extreme weather events in the last decade was 15 times higher than in less vulnerable ones.. Climate change is impacting health in a myriad of ways, including by leading to death and illness from increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms and floods, the disruption of food systems, increases in zoonoses and food-, water- and vector-borne diseases, and mental health issues. Furthermore, climate change is undermining many of the social determinants for good health, such as livelihoods, equality and access to health care and social support structures. These climate-sensitive health risks are disproportionately felt by the most vulnerable and disadvantaged, including women, children, ethnic minorities, poor communities, migrants or displaced persons, older populations, and those with underlying health conditions.. . Figure:\\xa0An overview of climate-sensitive health risks, their exposure pathways and vulnerability factors. Climate change impacts health both directly and indirectly, and is strongly mediated by environmental, social and public health determinants.. \\xa0. Although it is unequivocal that climate change affects human health, it remains challenging to accurately estimate the scale and impact of many climate-sensitive health risks. However, scientific advances progressively allow us to attribute an increase in morbidity and mortality to global warming, and more accurately determine the risks and scale of these health threats.. WHO data indicates 2\\xa0billion people lack safe drinking water and 600\\xa0million suffer from foodborne illnesses annually, with children under 5 bearing 30% of foodborne fatalities. Climate stressors heighten waterborne and foodborne disease risks. In 2020, 770\\xa0million faced hunger, predominantly in Africa and Asia. Climate change affects food availability, quality and diversity, exacerbating food and nutrition crises.. Temperature and precipitation changes enhance the spread of vector-borne diseases. Without preventive actions, deaths from such diseases, currently over 700 000 annually, may rise. Climate change induces both immediate mental health issues, like anxiety and post-traumatic stress, and long-term disorders due to factors like displacement and disrupted social cohesion.. Recent research attributes 37% of heat-related deaths to human-induced climate change. Heat-related deaths among those over 65 have risen by 70% in two decades. In 2020, 98\\xa0million more experienced food insecurity compared to the 1981–2010 average. The WHO conservatively projects 250\\xa0000 additional yearly deaths by the 2030s due to climate change impacts on diseases like malaria and coastal flooding. However, modelling challenges persist, especially around capturing risks like drought and migration pressures.. The climate crisis threatens to undo the last 50 years of progress in development, global health and poverty reduction, and to further widen existing health inequalities between and within populations. It severely jeopardizes the realization of UHC in various ways, including by compounding the existing burden of disease and by exacerbating existing barriers to accessing health services, often at the times when they are most needed. Over 930\\xa0million people – around 12% of the world’s population – spend at least 10% of their household budget to pay for health care. With the poorest people largely uninsured, health shocks and stresses already currently push around 100 million people into poverty every\\xa0year, with the impacts of climate change worsening this trend.. In the short- to medium-term, the health impacts of climate change will be determined mainly by the vulnerability of populations, their resilience to the current rate of climate change and the extent and pace of adaptation. In the longer-term, the effects will increasingly depend on the extent to which transformational action is taken now to reduce emissions and avoid the breaching of dangerous temperature thresholds and potential irreversible tipping points.. While no one is safe from these risks, the people whose health is being harmed first and worst by the climate crisis are the people who contribute least to its causes, and who are least able to protect themselves and their families against it: people in low-income and disadvantaged countries and communities.. Addressing climate change\\'s health burden underscores the equity imperative: those most responsible for emissions should bear the highest mitigation and adaptation costs, emphasizing health equity and vulnerable group prioritization.. To avert catastrophic health impacts and prevent millions of climate change-related deaths, the world must limit temperature rise to 1.°C. Past emissions have already made a certain level of global temperature rise and other changes to the climate inevitable. Global heating of even 1.°C is not considered safe, however; every additional tenth of a degree of warming will take a serious toll on people’s lives and health.. WHO’s response to these challenges centres around 3 main objectives:. Leadership and Raising Awareness: WHO leads in emphasizing climate change\\'s health implications, aiming to centralize health in climate policies, including through the UNFCCC. Partnering with major health agencies, health professionals and civil society, WHO strives to embed climate change in health priorities like UHC and target carbon neutrality by 2030.. Evidence and Monitoring: WHO, with its network of global experts, contributes global evidence summaries, provides assistance to nations in their assessments, and monitors progress. The emphasis is on deploying effective policies and enhancing access to knowledge and data.. Capacity Building and Country Support: Through WHO offices, support is given to ministries of health, focusing on collaboration across sectors, updated guidance, hands-on training, and support for project preparation and execution as well as for securing climate and health funding. WHO leads the Alliance for Transformative Action on Climate and Health (ATACH), bringing together a range of health and development partners, to support countries in achieving their commitments to climate-resilient and low carbon health systems.. Below are answers to some frequently asked questions about climate change. For information about evidence of climate change, the greenhouse effect, and the human role in climate change, please see EPA Climate Science.. On this page:. Some of the following links exit the site.. \"Weather\" refers to the day-to-day state of the atmosphere such as the combination of temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind, and other factors. \"Climate\" describes the weather of a place averaged over a period of time, often 30 years. Think about it this way: climate is something that can be expected to happen in general, like a cold winter season, whereas weather is what a person might experience on any given day, like a snowstorm in January or a sunny day in July.. Climate change involves significant changes in average conditions—such as temperature, precipitation, wind patterns, and other aspects of climate—that occur over years, decades, centuries, or longer. Climate change involves longer-term trends, such as shifts toward warmer, wetter, or drier conditions. These trends can be caused by\\xa0natural variability in climate over time, as well as human activities that add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere like burning fossil fuels for energy.. The terms \"global warming\" and \"climate change\" are sometimes used interchangeably, but global warming is just one of the ways in which climate is affected by rising concentrations of greenhouse gases. \"Global warming\" describes the recent rise in the global average temperature near the earth\\'s surface, which is caused mostly by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide and methane) in the atmosphere from human activities such as burning fossil fuels for energy.. Climate change occurs over a long period of time, typically over decades or longer. In contrast, climate variability includes changes that occur within shorter timeframes, such as a month, season, or year. Climate variability explains the natural variability within the system. For example, one unusually cold or wet year followed by an unusually warm or dry year would not be considered a sign of climate change.. Even though the planet is warming, some areas may be experiencing extra cold or snowy winters. These cold spells are due to variability in local weather patterns, which sometimes lead to colder-than-average seasons or even colder-than-average years at the local or regional level. In fact, a warmer climate traps more water vapor in the air, which may lead to extra snowy winters in some areas. As long as it is still cold enough to snow, a warming climate can lead to bigger snowstorms.. Yes. Climate scientists overwhelmingly agree that people are contributing significantly to today’s climate change, primarily by releasing excess greenhouse gases into the atmosphere from activities such as burning fossil fuels for energy, cultivating crops, raising livestock, and clearing forests. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\\'s Sixth Assessment ReportExit EPA’s website, which represents the work of hundreds of leading experts in climate science, statesExit EPA’s website that \"it is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.”. The 2018 National Climate AssessmentExit EPA’s website, developed by the\\u202fU.S. Global Change Research Program—which is composed of 13 federal scientific agencies—concluded that scientific evidence consistently points to human activities, rather than natural climate trends, as the “dominant cause” behind the rapid global temperature increase of 1.°F from 1901 to 2016 (see Figure 1). Hundreds of independent and governmental scientific organizations have released similar statements, both in the United States and worldwide, including the World Meteorological OrganizationExit EPA’s website, the American Meteorological SocietyExit EPA’s website, and the American Geophysical UnionExit EPA’s website.. The earth does go through natural cycles of warming and cooling caused by factors such as changes in the sun or volcanic activity. For example, there were times in the distant past when the earth was warmer than it is now. However, natural variations in climate do not explain today’s climate change. Most of the warming since 1950Exit EPA’s website has been caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases that come from a variety of activities, including burning fossil fuels.. A degree or two change in average global temperature might not sound like much to worry about, but relatively small changes in the earth’s average temperature can mean big changesExit EPA’s website in local and regional climate, creating risks to public health and safetyExit EPA’s website, water resourcesExit EPA’s website, agricultureExit EPA’s website, infrastructureExit EPA’s website, and ecosystemsExit EPA’s website. Among the many examples cited by the 2018 National Climate AssessmentExit EPA’s website are an increase in heat waves and days with temperatures above 90°F; more extreme weather events such as storms, droughts, and floods; and a projected sea level rise of 1 to 4 feet by the end of this century, which could put certain areas of the country underwater.. Climate change poses many threats to people’s health and well-being. Among the health impacts cited by the 2018 National Climate AssessmentExit EPA’s website are the following:. See EPA’s Climate Indicators website for more information about the effects of climate change in the United States.. Everyone will be affected by climate change, but some people may be more affected than others. Among the most vulnerable people are those in overburdened, underserved, and economically distressed communities. Three key factors influence a person’s vulnerability to the impacts of climate change:. In addition, there is a wide range of other factors that influence people’s vulnerability. For example, people with less access to healthcare, adequate housing, and financial resources are less likely to rebound from climate disasters. People who are excluded from planning processes, experience racial and ethnic discrimination, or have language barriers are also more vulnerable to and less able to prepare for and avoid the risks of climate change.. Learn more about the connections between climate change and human health.. People can reduce the risks of climate change by making choices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and by preparing for the changes expected in the future. Decisions that people make today will shape the world for decades and even centuries to come. Communities can also prepare for the changes in the decades ahead by identifying and reducing their vulnerabilities and considering climate change risks in planning and development. Such actions can ensure that the most vulnerable populations—such as young children, older adults, and people living in poverty—are protected from the health and safety threats of climate change.. The longer people wait to act on climate change, the more damaging its effects will become on the planet and people’s health. If people fail to take action soon, more drastic and costly measures to prevent greenhouse gases from exceeding dangerous levels could be needed later. The most recent National Climate AssessmentExit EPA’s website found that global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could avoid tens of thousands of deaths per year in the United States by the end of the century, as well as billions of dollars in damages related to water shortages, wildfires, agricultural losses, flooding, and other impacts. There are many actions that people can take now to help reduce the risk of climate change while also improving the natural environment, community infrastructure and transportation systems, and overall health.. Since the Industrial Revolution, human activities have released large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which has changed the earth’s climate. Natural processes, such as changes in the sun\\'s energy and volcanic eruptions, also affect the earth\\'s climate. However, they do not explain the warming that we have observed over the last century.. It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land.- Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change4. Scientists have pieced together a record of the earth’s climate by analyzing a number of indirect measures of climate, such as ice cores, tree rings, glacier lengths, pollen remains, and ocean sediments, and by studying changes in the earth’s orbit around the sun. This record shows that the climate varies naturally over a wide range of time scales, but this variability does not explain the observed warming since the 1950s. Rather, it is extremely likely (> 95%) that human activities have been the dominant cause of that warming.. Human activities have contributed substantially to climate change through:. Concentrations of the key greenhouse gases have all increased since the Industrial Revolution due to human activities. Carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide concentrations are now more abundant in the earth’s atmosphere than any time in the last 800,000 years. These greenhouse gas emissions have increased the greenhouse effect and caused the earth’s surface temperature to rise. Burning fossil fuels changes the climate more than any other human activity.. Carbon dioxide: Human activities currently release over 30 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year. Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have increased by more than 40 percent since pre-industrial times, from approximately 280 parts per million (ppm) in the 18th century7 to 414 ppm in 2020.. Methane: Human activities increased methane concentrations during most of the 20th century to more than 2. times the pre-industrial level, from approximately 722 parts per billion (ppb) in the 18th century9 to 1,867 ppb in 2019.. Nitrous oxide: Nitrous oxide concentrations have risen approximately 20 percent since the start of the Industrial Revolution, with a relatively rapid increase toward the end of the 20th century. Nitrous oxide concentrations have increased from a pre-industrial level of 270 ppb11 to 332 ppb in 2019.. For more information on greenhouse gas emissions, see the Greenhouse Gas Emissions website. To learn more about actions that can reduce these emissions, see What You Can Do. To translate abstract greenhouse gas emissions measurements into concrete terms, try using EPA\\'s Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator.. Activities such as agriculture, road construction, and deforestation can change the reflectivity of the earth\\'s surface, leading to local warming or cooling. This effect is observed in heat islands, which are urban centers that are warmer than the surrounding, less populated areas. One reason that these areas are warmer is that buildings, pavement, and roofs tend to reflect less sunlight than natural surfaces. While deforestation can increase the earth’s reflectivity globally by replacing dark trees with lighter surfaces such as crops, the net effect of all land-use changes appears to be a small cooling.. Emissions of small particles, known as aerosols, into the air can also lead to reflection or absorption of the sun\\'s energy. Many types of air pollutants undergo chemical reactions in the atmosphere to create aerosols. Overall, human-generated aerosols have a net cooling effect on the earth. Learn more about human-generated and natural aerosols.. Natural processes are always influencing the earth’s climate and can explain climate changes prior to the Industrial Revolution in the 1700s. However, recent climate changes cannot be explained by natural causes alone.. Changes in the earth’s orbit and its axis of rotation have had a big impact on climate in the past. For example, the amount of summer sunshine on the Northern Hemisphere, which is affected by changes in the planet’s orbit, appears to be the primary cause of past cycles of ice ages, in which the earth has experienced long periods of cold temperatures (ice ages), as well as shorter interglacial periods (periods between ice ages) of relatively warmer temperatures. At the coldest part of the last glacial period (or ice age), the average global temperature was about 11°F\\xa0colder than it is\\xa0today. At the peak of the last interglacial period, however, the average global temperature was\\xa0at most 2°F\\xa0warmer than it is today.. Changes in the sun’s energy output can affect the intensity of the sunlight that reaches the earth’s surface. While these changes can influence the earth’s climate, solar variations have played little role in the climate changes observed in recent decades. Satellites have been measuring the amount of energy the earth receives from the sun since 1978. These measurements show no net increase in the sun’s output, even as global surface temperatures have risen.. The amount of sunlight that is absorbed or reflected by the planet depends on the earth’s surface and atmosphere. Dark objects and surfaces, like the ocean, forests, and soil, tend to absorb more sunlight. Light-colored objects and surfaces, like snow and clouds, tend to reflect sunlight. About 70 percent of the sunlight that reaches the earth is absorbed. Natural changes in the earth’s surface, like the melting of sea ice, have contributed to climate change in the past, often acting as feedbacks\\xa0to other processes.. Volcanoes have played a noticeable role in climate, and volcanic eruptions released large quantities of carbon dioxide in the distant past. Some explosive volcano eruptions can throw particles (e.g., SO2)\\xa0into the upper atmosphere, where they can reflect enough sunlight back to space to cool the surface of the planet for several years. These particles are an example of cooling aerosols.. Volcanic particles from a single eruption do not produce long-term climate change because they remain in the atmosphere for a much shorter time than greenhouse gases. In addition, human activities emit more than 100 times as much carbon dioxide as volcanoes each year.. Over the last several hundred thousand years, carbon dioxide levels varied in tandem with the glacial cycles. During warm interglacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were higher. During cool glacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were lower. The heating or cooling of the earth’s surface and oceans can cause changes in the natural sources and sinks of these gases, and thus change greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. These changing concentrations have acted as a positive climate feedback, amplifying the temperature changes caused by long-term shifts in the earth’s orbit.. Climate change is happening. Global average temperature has increased about 1.°F from 1901 to 2016. Changes of one or two degrees in the average temperature of the planet can cause potentially dangerous shifts in climate and weather. These real, observable changes are what we call climate change\\xa0impacts\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b because they are the visible ways that climate change is affecting the Earth. For example, many places have experienced changes in rainfall, resulting in more floods, droughts, or intense rain, as well as more frequent and severe heat waves.. The planet\\'s oceans and glaciers have also experienced changes—oceans are warming and becoming more acidic, ice caps are melting, and sea level is rising. As these and other changes become more pronounced in the coming decades, they will likely present challenges to our society and our environment.. Climate change impacts our health, environment, and economy. For example:. Elevated concentrations of carbon dioxide will persist in the atmosphere for hundreds or thousands of years, so the earth will continue to warm in the coming decades. The warmer it gets, the greater the risk for more severe changes to the climate and the earth\\'s system. Although it\\'s difficult to predict the exact impacts of climate change, what\\'s clear is that the climate we are accustomed to is no longer a reliable guide for what to expect in the future.. Learn about some of the key concepts related to climate change:. The earth\\'s climate is changing. Multiple lines of evidence show changes in our weather, oceans, and ecosystems, such as:. These changes are due to a buildup of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere and the warming of the planet due to the greenhouse effect.. The earth\\'s temperature depends on the balance between energy entering and leaving the planet’s system. When sunlight reaches the earth’s surface, it can either be reflected back into space or absorbed by the earth. Incoming energy that is absorbed by the earth warms the planet. Once absorbed, the planet releases some of the energy back into the atmosphere as heat (also called infrared radiation). Solar energy that is reflected back to space does not warm the earth.. Certain gases in the atmosphere absorb energy, slowing or preventing the loss of heat to space. Those gases are known as “greenhouse gases.” They act like a blanket, making the earth warmer than it would otherwise be. This process, commonly known as the “greenhouse effect,” is natural and necessary to support life. However, the recent buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from human activities has changed the earth\\'s climate and resulted in dangerous effects to human health and welfare and to ecosystems.. . Most of the warming since 1950 has been caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases come from a variety of human activities, including burning fossil fuels for heat and energy, clearing forests, fertilizing crops, storing waste in landfills, raising livestock, and producing some kinds of industrial products.. Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas contributing to recent climate change. Carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere through burning fossil fuels, solid waste, trees, and other biological materials, and as a result of certain chemical reactions, such as cement manufacturing. Carbon dioxide is absorbed and emitted naturally as part of the carbon cycle, through plant and animal respiration, volcanic eruptions, and ocean-atmosphere exchange.. The carbon cycle is the process by which carbon continually moves from the atmosphere to the earth and then back to the atmosphere. On the earth, carbon is stored in rocks, sediments, the ocean, and in living organisms. Carbon is released back into the atmosphere when plants and animals die, as well as when fires burn, volcanoes erupt, and fossil fuels (such as coal, natural gas, and oil) are combusted. The carbon cycle ensures there is a balanced concentration of carbon in the different reservoirs on the planet. But a change in the amount of carbon in one reservoir affects all the others. Today, people are disturbing the carbon cycle by burning fossil fuels, which release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and through land use changes that remove plants, which absorb carbon from the atmosphere.. Source: Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, May 30, 2019. Both natural and human activities produce methane. For example, natural wetlands, agricultural activities, and fossil fuel extraction and transport all emit methane.. Nitrous oxide is produced mainly through agricultural activities and natural biological processes. Fossil fuel burning and industrial processes also create nitrous oxide.. Chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride, together called F-gases, are often used in coolants, foaming agents, fire extinguishers, solvents, pesticides, and aerosol propellants.. Different greenhouse gases can remain in the atmosphere for different amounts of time, ranging from a few years to thousands of years. In addition, some gases are more effective than others at making the planet warmer. Learn more about Global Warming Potential (GWP), a measure of climate impacts based on how long each greenhouse gas remains in the atmosphere and how strongly it absorbs energy.. Ground-level ozone is created by a chemical reaction between emissions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds from automobiles, power plants, and other industrial and commercial sources in the presence of sunlight. In addition to trapping heat, ground-level ozone is a pollutant that can cause respiratory health problems and damage crops and ecosystems.. Water vapor is another greenhouse gas and plays a key role in climate feedbacks because of its heat-trapping ability. Warmer air holds more moisture than cooler air. Therefore, as greenhouse gas concentrations increase and global temperatures rise, the total amount of water vapor in the atmosphere also increases, further amplifying the warming effect.. For more information on greenhouse gases, see Greenhouse Gas Emissions.. Aerosols in the atmosphere can affect climate. Aerosols are microscopic (solid or liquid) particles that are so small that instead of quickly falling to the surface like larger particles, they remain suspended in the air for days to weeks. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and biomass, contribute to emissions of these substances, although some aerosols also come from natural sources such as volcanoes and marine plankton.. Unlike greenhouse gases, the climate effects of aerosols vary depending on what they are made of and where they are emitted. Depending on their color and other factors, aerosols can either absorb or reflect sunlight. Aerosols that reflect sunlight, such as particles from volcanic eruptions or sulfur emissions from burning coal, have a cooling effect. Those that absorb sunlight, such as black carbon (a part of soot), have a warming effect.. Not only can black carbon directly absorb incoming and reflected sunlight, but it can also absorb infrared radiation. Black carbon can also be deposited on snow and ice, darkening the surface and thereby increasing the snow\\'s absorption of sunlight and accelerating melt. While reductions in all aerosols can lead to more warming, targeted reductions in black carbon emissions can reduce global warming. Warming and cooling aerosols can also interact with clouds, changing their ability to form and dissipate, as well as their reflectivity and precipitation rates. Clouds can contribute both to cooling, by reflecting sunlight, and warming, by trapping outgoing heat.. Climate feedbacks are natural processes that respond to global warming by offsetting or further increasing change in the climate system. Feedbacks that offset the change in climate are called negative feedbacks. Feedbacks that amplify changes are called positive feedbacks.. Water vapor appears to cause the most important positive feedback. As the earth warms, the rate of evaporation and the amount of water vapor in the air both increase. Because water vapor is a greenhouse gas, this leads to further warming.. \\n. The melting of Arctic sea ice is another example of a positive climate feedback. As temperatures rise, sea ice retreats. The loss of ice exposes the underlying sea surface, which is darker and absorbs more sunlight than ice, increasing the total amount of warming. Less snow cover during warm winters has a similar effect.. Clouds can have both warming and cooling effects on climate. They cool the planet by reflecting sunlight during the day, and they warm the planet by slowing the escape of heat to space (this is most apparent at night, as cloudy nights are usually warmer than clear nights).. Climate change can lead to changes in the coverage, altitude, and reflectivity of clouds. These changes can then either amplify (positive feedback) or dampen (negative feedback) the original change. The net effect of these changes is likely an amplifying, or positive, feedback due mainly to increasing altitude of high clouds in the tropics, which makes them better able to trap heat, and reductions in coverage of lower-level clouds in the mid-latitudes, which reduces the amount of sunlight they reflect. The magnitude of this feedback is uncertain due to the complex nature of cloud/climate interactions.. Engage. Include people with diverse backgrounds and experiences in community efforts to address climate change. Foster honest conversation, meet people where they are already active (such as in schools and community centers), and involve those leaders who are respected by the community. Indigenous and local knowledge can advance understanding of climate change effects and solutions. When possible, amplify the voices of those who are most vulnerable, underserved, or overburdened.\\xa0. Share. Connect communities with the information and data that can help them prepare for and adapt to climate impacts.

Climate-resilient solutions based on equity and inclusivity reduce vulnerability for everyone. Consider solutions that boost resilience while improving livelihoods, accessibility, and social and economic well-being. Solutions could include improving the efficiency of buildings, investing in low-carbon transportation networks, and adding green spaces in urban areas. Such solutions can also promote other local benefits by mitigating the effects of urban heat islands, reducing air pollution, and strengthening community interaction.. Prepare. Climate equity includes the ways communities prepare for and respond to extreme events. Consider how overburdened and underserved groups have different needs during an emergency.

Coral reefs are home to many sea creatures. When water is too warm or too cold, coral becomes damaged in a process called bleaching. If bleaching goes on for too long, it can kill the coral. . Dead Zones. Harmful algal blooms (HABs), sometimes called red tides, have been linked to increasing temperatures in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Some species of HABs can produce excessive amounts of biomass that can prevent light from getting below the ocean surface. As these organisms die and decompose, oxygen levels go down, making it harder for other organisms to survive. Other species of HABs can produce toxins that are hazardous to marine life and humans. .

Learn how reducing waste decreases our carbon footprint and what business, communities, and individuals can do.. Climate change is directly contributing to humanitarian emergencies from heatwaves, wildfires, floods, tropical storms and hurricanes and they are increasing in scale, frequency and intensity.. Research shows that 3.\\xa0billion people already live in areas highly susceptible to climate change. Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250\\xa0000 additional deaths per year, from undernutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress alone.. The direct damage costs to health (excluding costs in health-determining sectors such as agriculture and water and sanitation) is estimated to be between US$\\xa02–4\\xa0billion per year by 2030.. Areas with weak health infrastructure – mostly in developing countries – will be the least able to cope without assistance to prepare and respond.. Reducing emissions of greenhouse gases through better transport, food and energy use choices can result in very large gains for health, particularly through reduced air pollution.. Promote actions that both reduce carbon emissions and improve health: supporting a rapid and equitable transition to a clean energy economy; ensuring that health is central to climate change mitigation policy; accelerating mitigation actions that bring the greatest health gains; and mobilizing the strength of the health community to drive policy change and build public support.. Build better, more climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable health systems: ensuring core services, environmental sustainability and climate resilience as central components of UHC and primary health care (PHC); supporting health systems to leapfrog to cheaper, more reliable and cleaner solutions, while decarbonizing high-emitting health systems; and mainstreaming climate resilience and environmental sustainability into health service investments, including the capacity of the health workforce. . Protect health from the wide range of impacts of climate change: assessing health vulnerabilities and developing health plans; integrating climate risk and implementing climate-informed surveillance and response systems for key risks, such as extreme heat and infectious disease; supporting resilience and adaptation in health-determining sectors such as water and food; and closing the financing gap for health adaptation and resilience.\\xa0.

What are the benefits of taking action now?. Atmospheric warming has the potential to increase ground-level ozone in many regions, which can cause multiple health issuesExit EPA’s website (e.g., bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma) and worsen lung function.. Higher summer temperatures are linked to an increased risk of heat-related illnesses and death. Older adults, pregnant women, and children are at particular risk, as are people living in urban areas because of the additional heat associated with urban heat islands.. Climate change is expected to expose more people to ticks that carry Lyme disease or other bacterial and viral agents, and to mosquitoes that transmit West Nile and other viruses.. More frequent extreme weather events such as droughts, hurricanes, floods, and wildfires will not only put people’s lives at risk, but can also worsen underlying medical conditions, increase stress, and lead to adverse mental health effects.. Rising temperatures and extreme weather have the potential to disrupt the availability, safety, and nutritional quality of food.. Exposure. Some people are more at risk simply because they are more exposed to climate change hazards where they live or work. For example, people who live on the coast can be more vulnerable to sea level rise, coastal storms, and flooding.. Sensitivity. Some people are more sensitive to the impacts of climate change, such as children, pregnant women, and those with pre-existing medical conditions such as asthma.. Adaptability. Older adults, those with disabilities, those with low income, and some indigenous people may have more difficulty than others in adapting to climate change hazards.. Greenhouse Gas Emissions. Reflectivity or Absorption of the Sun’s Energy. Warmer temperatures increase the frequency, intensity, and duration of heat waves,2 which can pose health risks, particularly for young children and the elderly.. Climate change can also impact human health by worsening air and water quality, increasing the spread of certain diseases, and altering the frequency or intensity of extreme weather events.. Rising sea level threatens coastal communities and ecosystems.. Changes in the patterns and amount of rainfall, as well as changes in the timing and amount of stream flow, can affect water supplies and water quality and the production of hydroelectricity.. Changing ecosystems influence geographic ranges of many plant and animal species and the timing of their lifecycle events, such as migration and reproduction.. Increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as heat waves, droughts, and floods, can increase losses to property, cause costly disruptions to society, and reduce the affordability of insurance..
