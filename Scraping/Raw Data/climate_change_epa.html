      <figcaption class="figure__caption">The climate change impacts facing many U.S. sectors can influence certain groups disproportionately. Visit our&nbsp;<a href="/climateimpacts/climate-change-impacts-sector">Climate Change Impacts by Sector</a> section to learn about these effects.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Climate change does not affect all people equally. Some communities experience disproportionate impacts because of existing vulnerabilities, historical patterns of inequity, socioeconomic disparities, and systemic environmental injustices (e.g., redlining). People who already face the greatest burdens are often the ones affected most by climate change.</p>

<p>EPA is committed to supporting communities—particularly those facing disproportionate impacts—develop and implement equitable solutions to climate change impacts. Only through collaboration across all communities and levels of government can the nation make progress in addressing systemic factors that impact climate equity.</p>

<p>Climate equity is the goal of recognizing and addressing the unequal burdens made worse by climate change, while ensuring that all people share the benefits of climate protection efforts. Achieving equity means that all people—regardless of their race, color, gender, age, sexuality, national origin, ability, or income—live in safe, healthy, fair communities.</p>

<div class="box box--related-info">
<h2 class="box__title">Climate Equity and Environmental Justice</h2>

<div class="box__content">
<p>Climate equity is a part of the overarching aim of environmental justice, which is a cornerstone of <a href="/aboutepa/our-mission-and-what-we-do">EPA’s mission</a>. <a href="/environmentaljustice">Environmental justice</a> is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.&nbsp;Striving for climate equity is putting these same values into practice when tackling climate change impacts, and ensuring that everyone has equal access to resources and safe spaces.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Climate equity can be woven into the broader efforts to address the socioeconomic, sociocultural, and physical impacts of climate change. It is a public health issue in every respect. The following principles can help governments, community leaders, and community members incorporate climate equity considerations in their work:</p>























  <ul><li><span><strong>Engage. </strong>Include people with diverse backgrounds and experiences in community efforts to address climate change. Foster honest conversation, meet people where they are already active (such as in schools and community centers), and involve those leaders who are respected by the community. Indigenous and local knowledge can advance understanding of climate change effects and solutions. When possible, amplify the voices of those who are most vulnerable, underserved, or overburdened.&nbsp;</span></li>
	<li><span><strong>Share. </strong>Connect communities with the information and data that can help them prepare for and adapt to climate impacts. Helping communities access relevant resources enables them to refine their climate resiliency efforts and empowers them to develop targeted, grassroots solutions.</span></li>
	<li><span><strong>Build. </strong>Climate-resilient solutions based on equity and inclusivity reduce vulnerability for everyone. Consider solutions that boost resilience while improving livelihoods, accessibility, and social and economic well-being. Solutions could include improving the efficiency of buildings, investing in low-carbon transportation networks, and adding green spaces in urban areas. Such solutions can also promote other local benefits by mitigating the effects of urban heat islands, reducing air pollution, and strengthening community interaction.</span></li>
	<li><span><strong>Prepare. </strong>Climate equity includes the ways communities prepare for and respond to extreme events. Consider how overburdened and underserved groups have different needs during an emergency. Being ready to address those specific needs is a part of effective disaster response and overall good governance. Solutions could include providing language or accessibility services.</span></li>
</ul><div class="box box--related-info">
<h2 class="box__title">Overlapping Vulnerabilities</h2>

<div class="box__content">
<p>Some communities may be part of multiple groups that are particularly vulnerable to climate change. For example, one community could have a higher percentage of pregnant women or children, which could increase their vulnerability to particulate emissions. In another example, communities with a high elderly population, which is also non-English speaking, may be more susceptible to climate impacts because their limited access to resources compounds their health risks. Those risks extend to a broader community if it is disproportionately made up of socially vulnerable populations. This is one reason why communities are not impacted proportionally.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Climate Change Impacts on Vulnerable Populations</h2>

<p>Part of understanding climate equity is recognizing specific populations that are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts. You can learn more about the relationship between exposure, vulnerability, and human health by how they interact within communities.

  </figure><p>Climate change impacts happen at varying scales, including globally, regionally, and locally. For example, while a region may experience drier conditions, some localities within that region may experience wetter conditions. Recognizing the scope and scale of these impacts helps us better understand the ways climate change affects us where we live.&nbsp;</p>

<p>EPA is currently developing new content that presents the climate change impacts that regions and states are already experiencing. This suite of material will present climate impacts for all 50 U.S. states plus Washington, DC and territories, as well as broader geographic regions within the United States. Climate impacts highlighted will focus on features of individual states or territories that are iconic or culturally meaningful for that area.</p>

<p>While new content is under development, you may wish to explore other resources relevant to the state and regional impacts of climate change, such as the&nbsp; <a href="https://statesummaries.ncics.org/" data-once="external-links protected-links">State Climate Summaries<svg class="icon icon--exit is-spaced-before" role="img"><title>Exit EPA’s website</title><use href="/themes/epa_theme/images/sprite.svg#launch"></use></svg></a> published by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), or the&nbsp;<a href="https://nca2023.globalchange.gov/" data-once="external-links protected-links">Fifth National Climate Assessment<svg class="icon icon--exit is-spaced-before" role="img"><title>Exit EPA’s website</title><use href="/themes/epa_theme/images/sprite.svg#launch"></use></svg></a>, which includes chapters discussing climate impacts on specific regions in the United States.</p>

      <figcaption class="figure__caption"><em>Diet, living situation, health care access, and other factors can increase children’s vulnerability to climate change health hazards.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Children, including adolescents under the age of 18, are often more vulnerable than the general population to the health impacts of climate change because:</p>

<ul><li>Children’s bodies are <strong>developing physically</strong>, which can make them more vulnerable to climate-related hazards like heat and poor air quality. They also <strong>breathe at a faster rate</strong>, increasing their exposure to dangerous air pollutants.<a href="#1foot"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
	<li>Children tend to <strong>spend more time outdoors</strong> than adults, increasing their exposure to heat and cold, rain and snow, outdoor allergens, and insect bites.<a href="#2foot"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
	<li>Children drink more water than adults per pound of body weight.<a href="#3foot"><sup>3</sup></a> They <strong>swallow about twice as much water</strong> as adults while <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/index.html" data-once="external-links protected-links">swimming<svg class="icon icon--exit is-spaced-before" role="img"><title>Exit EPA’s website</title><use href="/themes/epa_theme/images/sprite.svg#launch"></use></svg></a>. This can increase their exposure to certain contaminants in recreational waters and the risk of developing gastrointestinal or other illnesses.<a href="#4foot"><sup>4</sup></a></li>
	<li>Children are <strong>developing emotionally</strong>, as their brains continue to grow throughout adolescence. Children can experience mental health impacts from major storms, fires, and other extreme events that are expected to increase with a changing climate. They also can suffer from other changes, such as having to move due to climate threats.</li>
	<li>Young children <strong>depend on adults</strong> for their safety and well-being. This dependence can put children at greater risk during extreme events. For example, without adult help, children may not be able to keep their heads above floodwaters or get to safety during a storm.<a href="#5foot"><sup>5</sup></a></li>

<h3 id="insect">Insect- and Tick-Related Diseases</h3>

<p>Climate change is expanding the habitat ranges and length of time when insects and ticks are common.<a href="#27foot"><sup>27</sup></a> In some regions, that results in a northward expansion of where ticks may live; while other areas could also see ticks active for longer periods throughout the year.<a href="#28foot"><sup>28</sup></a> Warmer temperatures associated with climate change can also increase mosquito development and biting rates, while increased rainfall can create breeding sites for mosquitos.<a href="#29foot"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<p>Because children spend a lot of time outdoors, they are vulnerable to insect and tick bites that can cause illnesses like <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/symptoms/index.html" data-once="external-links protected-links">West Nile virus<svg class="icon icon--exit is-spaced-before" role="img"><title>Exit EPA’s website</title><use href="/themes/epa_theme/images/sprite.svg#launch"></use></svg></a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/tickbornediseases/lyme.html" data-once="external-links protected-links">Lyme disease<svg class="icon icon--exit is-spaced-before" role="img"><title>Exit EPA’s website</title><use href="/themes/epa_theme/images/sprite.svg#launch"></use></svg></a>.

<div class="box__content">
<p>Parents, caregivers, coaches, and school administrators can take steps to reduce the health impacts of climate change on children. Consider the following action items:</p>

<ul><li>When temperatures soar, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/extremeheat/children.html" data-once="external-links protected-links">keep kids cool and encourage them to drink enough water<svg class="icon icon--exit is-spaced-before" role="img"><title>Exit EPA’s website</title><use href="/themes/epa_theme/images/sprite.svg#launch"></use></svg></a>. Watch for signs of dehydration or overheating. Offer sips of water often and find places to cool off. Have children exercise earlier in the day when it is cooler outside. Never leave children in a parked car. Wear sunscreen when outdoors.</li>
	<li>Check the <a href="https://www.airnow.gov/" data-once="external-links protected-links">Air Quality Index</a> and pollen counts on your local weather reports. Also, pay attention to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="feb40ee8-32ee-45ee-a62a-dde3bf85ce04" href="/children/protecting-childrens-health-during-and-after-natural-disasters-wildfires-volcanic-ash">wildfire, smoke, and ash warnings</a>. When the air quality is poor, consider limiting children’s time outdoors. Have children avoid playing in high-traffic areas.</li>

Make sure your family has an evacuation or safety plan if you live in an area prone to severe weather. After a flood, watch for signs of mold and be sure to clean and dry affected areas. Focus on providing your children access to clean potable water, and avoid having them wade in floodwaters or be exposed to debris from disasters. If children are exposed to storms or floods, watch for diarrhea symptoms. Don’t allow children to participate in disaster cleanup to avoid exposing them to toxic materials which are often found in debris.</li>
	<li>Talk to your pediatrician if you think your child’s health, including their mental well-being, has been affected by climate change.</li>

  <h2>Overview</h2>

<p><span>The U.S. transportation system is essential to moving people and goods. It includes:</span></p>

<ul><li><strong>Infrastructure</strong>, such as airports, train stations, roads, bridges, pipelines, and bike trails.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><span><strong>Vehicles</strong>, including cars, buses, trucks, trains, ships, and aircraft.</span></li>
	<li><span><strong>People</strong>, including equipment operators, designers, builders, and transportation officials.</span></li>
</ul><p><span>Although the nation’s transportation system is built to withstand weather, climate change may affect this system over time.<sup><a href="#1foot">1</a></sup> The impacts will vary by region. However, impacts in one region can readily affect another. For example, bridge damage in one place can cause road congestion in another. Changing water levels in one area may affect shipping nationwide.<sup><a href="#2foot">2</a></sup></span></p>

<p>Climate change may affect transportation at local, regional, and national scales. Three key impacts are described in this section.</p>

<h3>1. Impacts on System Safety and Function</h3>










<figure class="figure  figure--image figure--small   u-align-right"><div class="figure__media">

    <img srcset="/system/files/styles/small/private/images/2022-10/transportation2.jpg?itok=jmES1-FM 320w, /system/files/styles/medium/private/images/2022-10/transportation2.jpg?itok=yRdOx2Wv 409w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) calc(100vw - 2rem), 320px" src="/system/files/styles/small/private/images/2022-10/transportation2.jpg?itok=jmES1-FM" width="320" height="427" alt="closeup view of cracks in a road." loading="lazy"></div>

      <figcaption class="figure__caption">In Alaska, thawing permafrost has severely damaged airport runways, railroads, and pipelines.<a href="#16foot">16</a></figcaption></figure><p><span>In many regions, sea level rise, changes in precipitation, extreme weather, and heat pose risks to the transportation system.<sup><a href="#5foot">5</a></sup> These hazards may affect system performance, safety, and reliability.</span><sup><a href="#6foot">6</a></sup><span>&nbsp;In coastal regions, rising sea levels and more extreme storms can lead to more storm surge and flooding, which can damage roads, bridges, railways, ports, and coastal airports.<sup><a href="#7foot">7</a></sup> Increased local flooding can affect roadways and tunnels, weaken roadway materials, and cause traffic congestion. As a result, people may have trouble getting to their homes, schools, stores, and medical appointments.<sup><a href="#8foot">8</a></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Across inland regions, heavy rains can cause flooding and mudslides, affecting highways, railways, and bridges.<sup><a href="#9foot">9</a>,<a href="#10foot">10</a></sup>&nbsp; Lack of rain can also be a concern. Drought combined with extreme heat increases wildfire risk.<sup><a href="#11foot">11</a></sup> Wildfires can damage transportation networks and impair drivers’ visibility.</span></p>

<p><span>Rising temperatures can affect transportation in many regions. These impacts can be both immediate and long-lasting. For example, heat affects runways, and hotter air can make it more difficult for airplanes to take flight.<sup><a href="#12foot">12</a></sup> Heat can also damage rail tracks and cause cracks in roads.<sup><a href="#13foot">13</a></sup> In addition, heat can pose safety risks to transportation workers and travelers. For example, vehicles can overheat and roadway joints can buckle, leading to accidents.<sup><a href="#14foot">14</a></sup></span></p>

<p><span>Warmer temperatures can also cause <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f08fb96b-2338-4665-ae23-80c5093641f4" href="/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-permafrost">permafrost</a> to thaw. Permafrost currently supports roads, airport runways, pipelines, and railroads in Alaska. Thawing permafrost can weaken this critical infrastructure</span><span>.</span><sup><a href="#15foot">15</a></sup></p>

<h3>2. System Costs and the Economy</h3>

<p>Climate change can have both positive and negative impacts on transportation system costs. For example, milder winters in some regions could cut the costs of winter road maintenance.<sup><a href="#17foot">17</a></sup> However, other areas may see more damage to roads, bridges, and transit systems from heat, weather, and rising sea levels. As a result, costs to maintain, repair, and replace infrastructure are likely to increase.<sup><a href="#18foot">18</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Climate change impacts on transportation can also have wide economic effects. One positive impact is that warmer weather could lengthen the shipping season for some northern ports.<sup><a href="#19foot">19</a></sup> Damage to the transportation system, however, can interrupt the supply chain at local, regional, and national levels.<sup><a href="#20foot">20</a></sup></p>

<p>In some coastal areas, more flooding is occurring as the sea level rises.<sup><a href="#21foot">21</a></sup> Urban areas where there is a lot of pavement or where sewer systems cannot handle intense rainfall also are prone to flooding. Flooding disrupts the movement of commuters, tourists, and freight.<sup><a href="#22foot">22</a></sup> People also need reliable transportation to get to their jobs. Extreme weather can disrupt transit options and damage roads, keeping people from getting to work.<sup><a href="#23foot">23</a></sup></p>

<h3>3. Reduced Access to Social Services and Necessities</h3>

      <figcaption class="figure__caption">Urban dwellers and people with disabilities are especially vulnerable to public transit disruptions.</figcaption></figure><p>Climate-related impacts on the transportation system affects both urban and rural areas. For example, in urban areas, heavy rains can flood tunnels and underground rail stops, affecting residents’ ability to access critical services and necessities.<sup><a href="#24foot">24</a></sup> However, people in cities may also have other transportation options, including walking.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In rural areas, there are typically fewer roads and transportation options than in cities. A single damaged road or bridge can cut off people’s access to services and necessities, such as food or medicine.<sup><a href="#25foot">25</a></sup> Rural communities can also face rebuilding challenges, including being able to bring in construction materials.<sup><a href="#26foot">26</a></sup></p>

  <p><span>Increasing emissions of <a href="/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases">greenhouse gases</a> into the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels are causing changes in the ocean (see box). These changes can alter which species of marine life thrive best in certain areas. For example, many fish have shifted their typical range as water temperatures rise.<sup><a href="#2foot">2</a></sup> However, other species are expected to decline in number or leave areas that are no longer favorable for them.<sup><a href="#3foot">3</a></sup> These shifts can have significant impacts on marine ecosystems and on fishing communities.<sup><a href="#4foot">4</a></sup></span></p>

<p><span>Many climate change impacts will only be avoided by reducing carbon dioxide emissions.<sup><a href="#5foot">5</a></sup> Climate-driven changes in the ocean are motivating people to find solutions to the new challenges. For example, new forecast tools are helping predict changes in ocean conditions that can help the fishing industry adapt.

<p>Climate change affects the ocean in many ways. Three key impacts are described in this section.</p>

<h3>1. Changes in Ocean Ecosystems</h3>










<figure class="figure  figure--image figure--small   u-align-right"><div class="figure__media">

    <img srcset="/system/files/styles/small/private/images/2022-11/oceans-boat.jpg?itok=OGYOUbU6 320w, /system/files/styles/medium/private/images/2022-11/oceans-boat.jpg?itok=DCmF2qD7 640w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) calc(100vw - 2rem), 320px" src="/system/files/styles/small/private/images/2022-11/oceans-boat.jpg?itok=OGYOUbU6" width="320" height="198" alt="Fishing boat" loading="lazy"></div>

      <figcaption class="figure__caption">Commercial fishing is a major industry in Alaska. Some fish populations will shift north to Alaska because of rising water temperatures while other communities will suffer declines.<a href="#9foot">9</a></figcaption></figure><p>Climate changes to the physical and chemical makeup of the ocean have significant impacts on marine ecosystems. For example, water temperature influences which species can live in an area. <a href="/ocean-acidification/introduction-ocean-and-coastal-acidification">Acidification</a> affects many animals’ ability to make shells or skeletons, while low oxygen levels can contribute to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="91b23ee5-0c27-4143-9cd1-44c93605d06b" href="/ms-htf">hypoxia</a>, or <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/deadzone.html" data-once="external-links protected-links">dead zones<svg class="icon icon--exit is-spaced-before" role="img"><title>Exit EPA’s website</title><use href="/themes/epa_theme/images/sprite.svg#launch"></use></svg></a>. Warm temperatures can exacerbate the effects of both acidification and hypoxia.<sup><a href="#6foot">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Impacts on one species can ripple across an entire ecosystem. For example, plankton—tiny organisms at the bottoms of many marine <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/marine-life/aquatic-food-webs" data-once="external-links protected-links">food chains<svg class="icon icon--exit is-spaced-before" role="img"><title>Exit EPA’s website</title><use href="/themes/epa_theme/images/sprite.svg#launch"></use></svg></a>—are sensitive to water temperatures and oxygen concentrations. They can die off if the water gets too warm. Animals farther up the food chain, like whales, can suffer food shortages when this happens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Climate changes to the marine environment will come in many forms. For instance, the diversity of some temperate ecosystems is expected to increase.<sup><a href="#7foot">7</a></sup> But overall, climate change is projected to disrupt marine ecosystems in ways that reduce the services they provide and their diversity of life.<sup><a href="#8foot">8</a></sup></p>

<h3>2. More Common and Severe Extreme Marine Events</h3>

<p>Rising water temperatures, acidification, and low oxygen levels can combine with natural <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/weather-atmosphere/el-nino" data-once="external-links protected-links">ocean cycles<svg class="icon icon--exit is-spaced-before" role="img"><title>Exit EPA’s website</title><use href="/themes/epa_theme/images/sprite.svg#launch"></use></svg></a> to create extreme marine events. Marine heat waves, dead zones, and <a href="/coral-reefs/threats-coral-reefs">coral bleaching</a> are just a few examples of these events, which are projected to become more common and severe.<sup><a href="#10foot">10</a></sup> Extreme events can harm marine ecosystems and communities connected to these systems. For example, a large heat wave off the West Coast in 2014 shut down crab fisheries and starved baby sea lions.<sup><a href="#11foot">11</a></sup></p>

<h3>3. Impacts on Marine Fisheries</h3>

For example, pollock and cod are moving north to colder water as local ocean temperatures rise.<sup><a href="#13foot">13</a></sup></p>

<p>The movement of fish into new areas disrupts the ecosystems that they move into. It can also cause confusion about what fishing regulations apply.<sup><a href="#14foot">14</a></sup> Changes in where fish live may also mean boats have to travel further from ports, potentially increasing costs.<sup><a href="#15foot">15</a></sup></p>

<p>Climate change is also affecting the timing of seasonal events, which can affect fisheries. For example, some species, such as striped bass, are spawning earlier in the year.<sup><a href="#16foot">16</a></sup> This means that catches can peak earlier than normal. Fisheries will need to adapt to such changes or risk reduced catches and lost revenues, which can also increase prices for consumers.<sup><a href="#17foot">17</a></sup></p>

<p>Changes in the locations and number of fish species in the ocean can present new opportunities in some cases. For example, scientists predict that some areas, such as the Bering Sea, will see more kinds of fish as warming waters drive populations north.<sup><a href="#18foot">18</a></sup> This could lead to new fishing opportunities and economic growth in that region.</p>

The marine economy generated over $665 billion in sales in 2019, with tourism and recreation, including recreational fishing, making up more than one-third of that total.<sup><a href="#20foot">20</a></sup> The marine economy also generated $397 billion in gross domestic product (GDP), which was 1.9% of the national GDP.<sup><a href="#21foot">21</a></sup></p>

<p>Commercial fisheries are an important contributor to the economy. In 2019, they produced 9.3 billion pounds of seafood valued at $5.5 billion.<sup><a href="#22foot">22</a></sup> Other businesses, such as grocery stores, tackle shops, and restaurants, also benefit from fishery-related products and services.</p>

<p>As of 2019, almost 2.4 million Americans had jobs related to the ocean in fields including fisheries, construction, tourism, real estate, food service, and transportation.<sup><a href="#23foot">23</a></sup> The Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are both key trade channels for importing and exporting goods.<sup><a href="#24foot">24</a></sup> The United States also extracts oil, gas, sand, and gravel from the ocean.</p>

<p>The ocean also provides many benefits that are harder to measure in economic terms.

<p>Healthy oceans provide Americans with food and employment and are important to cultural traditions. Climate change leaves communities that depend on the ocean vulnerable to hardship. Many fishing communities already experience high rates of poverty.<sup><a href="#25foot">25</a></sup> Unstable fish populations and market pricing can hurt fishing communities’ earnings.<sup><a href="#26foot">26</a></sup> This is especially true if a community depends on a single species for their livelihoods.</p>

<p>Ocean health is a cornerstone of many <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0a2db2f9-c2fa-442e-90cb-6f811acb6ddb" href="/climateimpacts/climate-change-and-health-indigenous-populations">Indigenous cultures</a>. Native American, Pacific Islander, and <a href="/bristolbay/engaging-bristol-bays-tribal-communities">Alaska Native</a> communities often practice subsistence fishing.<sup><a href="#27foot">27</a>,<a href="#28foot">28</a></sup> Fluctuating fish populations can lead to food insecurity for rural Alaskan villages, where many people depend on locally caught fish for a large portion of their diet.<sup><a href="#29foot">29</a></sup> For example, populations of Chinook and chum salmon hit record lows in 2021, leading to the closure of subsistence salmon fishing for much of the year.<sup><a href="#30foot">30</a></sup> The number of shellfish, another important part of subsistence diets, has also been declining due to ocean acidification.<sup><a href="#31foot">31</a></sup></p>

<p>Climate change also affects Indigenous people culturally. Gathering and preparing food provide social, spiritual, and economic benefits for Indigenous communities.<sup><a href="#32foot">32</a>,<a href="#33foot">33</a></sup> Disruptions to subsistence practices have negative health outcomes such as anxiety disorders and feelings of isolation.<sup><a href="#34foot">34</a></sup><br>

  <h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Health is key to our well-being, happiness, and general quality of life. It is also important for economic progress and productivity. A person’s health may depend on many factors, such as their income, race, gender, age, existing medical conditions or genetics, occupation, and where they live.<sup><a href="#1foot">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Personal choices and social support structures also play a role in a person’s health.</p>

<p>Climate change also affects people’s health in many ways. As the climate changes, more people may be exposed to extreme weather like heat, floods, droughts, storms, and wildfires.<sup><a href="#2foot">2</a></sup> These events can cause illness, injury, and even death. Climate change can also lead to more diseases spread by insects and ticks, and it can affect the quality and safety of air, water, and food, including through the spread of harmful bacteria or viruses.<sup><a href="#3foot">3</a></sup> In addition, hazards related to climate change can stress people’s mental health.<sup><a href="#4foot">4</a></sup> For information on how climate change can affect the health of different groups of people, see <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7769aad3-ccdf-41ea-86bd-08d4d0f74f32" href="/climateimpacts/climate-change-and-human-health">Climate Change and Health</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="topc">Top Climate Impacts on Health</h2>

<p>Health impacts from climate change vary depending on factors like a person’s age, medical condition, income, and where they live. Four key impacts are described in this section.</p>

<h3>1. Threats to Safety and Health from Extreme Weather</h3>

<p>As the climate changes, some extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and/or intense, &nbsp;posing risks to people’s health and safety.

<p><em>Photo caption endnote:</em><sup><a href="#26foot">26</a></sup></p>

<p>Climate change impacts on food vary widely. Longer growing seasons may be helpful for some crops, but detrimental to others. Taken together, these changes will present added challenges to farmers looking to plant successful crops that sustain their livelihood. A warmer climate may also lead to more pests or limit the types of crops that can grow in an area.<sup><a href="#15foot">15</a></sup> This may make it harder for some people to access safe, nutritious food. In addition, climate change may increase people’s exposure to certain bacteria that can cause illnesses, such as <em>Salmonella</em> or <em>E. coli</em>.<sup><a href="#16foot">16</a></sup></p>

<h3>4. Threats to Mental Health and Well-Being</h3>

<p>Both immediate and long-term climate change effects can contribute to mental health challenges, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. For instance, climate-related natural disasters can be traumatic, especially for children.<sup><a href="#26foot">26</a></sup> Natural disasters can lead to a loss of stability, community, and sometimes one’s home or property. Households that experience floods report higher levels of anxiety and depression, sometimes for years afterwards.<sup><a href="#27foot">27</a></sup> Natural disasters and droughts can also lead to more tobacco and alcohol use, as well as domestic violence<sup>.<a href="#28foot">28</a>,&nbsp;<a href="#29foot">29</a></sup> In addition, heat overall has been linked to increases in violence.<sup><a href="#30foot">30</a></sup></p>

<p><span>Climate plays an important role in the makeup, function, and health of forests. Therefore, changes in climate, such as in temperature and precipitation, can have direct impacts on forests. These impacts vary by region and forest type. Some impacts may be beneficial while others could be damaging.

  </figure><p>Forests are a critical part of the <a href="/climatechange-science/basics-climate-change">carbon cycle</a> and can help to lessen the impacts of climate change worldwide. Forests absorb carbon as they grow, acting as a carbon storage “bank” that helps to offset fossil fuel emissions. If trees are cut or burned, a forest temporarily releases part of this stored carbon to the atmosphere. When forests are converted to other uses, such as farming or development, they permanently release nearly all their carbon.<sup><a href="#6foot">6</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Climate change may affect forests at both local and regional scales. The impacts can vary even within a single forest. Three key impacts are described in this section.</p>

<h3>1. Natural Disturbances</h3>

<p>Climate change will influence a number of natural <a href="https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/disturbances-and-stressors" data-once="external-links protected-links">disturbances<svg class="icon icon--exit is-spaced-before" role="img"><title>Exit EPA’s website</title><use href="/themes/epa_theme/images/sprite.svg#launch"></use></svg></a> that threaten forest health. These include insect outbreaks, invasive species, wildfires, and storms.<sup><a href="#7foot">7</a></sup> Some disturbances, like a wildfire, take place quickly. Others, like changes in animal or plant populations, happen over decades to centuries.<sup><a href="#8foot">8</a></sup> Some of their effects may be temporary, allowing a forest to recover. In other cases, a forest may suffer lasting impacts.<sup><a href="#9foot">9</a></sup></p>

<p>Some forests may benefit from certain climate impacts. For instance, warmer temperatures can lead to more tree and plant growth in regions where cold weather limits the growing season.<sup><a href="#10foot">10</a></sup> However, in other forests, warmer temperatures may allow invasive species to thrive.<sup><a href="#11foot">11</a>,<a href="#12foot">12</a></sup>&nbsp;Warmer weather can also encourage insect survivial and growth. Over the past decade, climate change has led to an increase in <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/ccrc/topics/bark-beetles-and-climate-change-united-states" data-once="external-links protected-links">bark beetle damage<svg class="icon icon--exit is-spaced-before" role="img"><title>Exit EPA’s website</title><use href="/themes/epa_theme/images/sprite.svg#launch"></use></svg></a> to mountain pines in parts of the West.<sup><a href="#13foot">13</a></sup></p>

<p>Disturbances can also interact with one another to increase risks to forests. For example, drought can weaken trees and make a forest more vulnerable to wildfire or insect outbreaks. Similarly, wildfires can make a forest more vulnerable to pests.<sup><a href="#14foot">14</a></sup> Climate impacts can also interact with other stressors, like land development, that decrease a forest’s ability to adapt.<sup><a href="#15foot">15</a></sup></p>

<h3>2. Reduced Carbon Storage</h3>

<p>Climate change is expected to affect forests’ ability to provide key <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="62ddbaa2-85c3-4665-8b71-d5cd0aec7f4a" href="/climateimpacts/climate-change-impacts-ecosystems">ecosystem services</a>, including carbon storage, clean air, water supply, recreation, and wildlife habitat.<sup><a href="#16foot">16</a></sup> One of the most important ecosystem services forests provide is absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in roots, soil, aboveground tree growth, and the forest floor.<sup><a href="#17foot">17</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Climate change can affect carbon storage in several ways. For example, it may bring more frequent and intense rainfall to some regions.<sup><a href="#18foot">18</a></sup> Heavy precipitation and flooding can erode forest soils and cause stored carbon to be released back into the atmosphere. Damage to forests from more wildfires, insects, and disease outbreaks can also release stored carbon.<sup><a href="#19foot">19</a></sup></p>

<h3>3. Impacts on Water Resources</h3>

      <figcaption class="figure__caption">In the West, snowfall amount, timing, and melting are affecting water availability and stream water quality.<a href="#23foot">23</a></figcaption></figure><p>Another key ecosystem service that forests provide is water for drinking, irrigation, recreation, and other uses. Forest watersheds also moderate extreme weather impacts, such as flooding from heavy rainfall, on downstream communities and ecosystems.<sup><a href="#20foot">20</a></sup></p>

<p>Droughts, wildfires, rising temperatures, and reduced snowfall and snowpack due to climate change can all limit a watershed’s ability to provide these services.<sup><a href="#21foot">21</a></sup> For example, more frequent or severe droughts could reduce streamflow in some forests. Less streamflow means less water may be available for people to use. Reduced streamflow can also affect some plants and animals, such as fish that migrate to certain streams to reproduce.<sup><a href="#22foot">22</a></sup></p>

<p>Many rural communities benefit from their location near scenic forests.<sup><a href="#32foot">32</a></sup> Climate change impacts on these forests may disrupt tourism and outdoor activities that are key sources of revenue for these communities.</p>

<p>Urban forests—such as parks, gardens, and nature preserves—provide important benefits to neighborhoods within <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="23f411a2-ecdf-4771-a150-8a9c1ca4fafa" href="/climateimpacts/climate-change-impacts-built-environment">cities</a>.<sup><a href="#33foot">33</a></sup> As the climate changes, impacts like extreme weather, heat, and soil and air quality changes can stress urban forests.

  <p>Climate change affects where, when, and how much water is available. These effects vary by region and can harm the health of people and ecosystems. For example, rising temperatures, drought, and reduced snowfall are putting more pressure on water supplies in the Southwest.<sup><a href="#1foot">1</a></sup> In contrast, the Northeast and Southeast may experience more extreme storms and heavy rains, which can put aging water infrastructure (such as dams, sewers, and water treatment facilities) at risk.<sup><a href="#2foot">2</a></sup></p>

<p>To help reduce climate risks, many water utilities are considering potential impacts to their systems and taking steps to build resilience. Government agencies are supporting many resilience projects specifically focused on water resources. Individuals can also take steps to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bb5e1088-20fc-4d99-ab17-88111d488466" href="/climate-change/what-you-can-do-about-climate-change-water">use water efficiently</a> and help keep water bodies clean.</p>

</div>
</div>























  <h2 id="topc">Top Climate Impacts on Freshwater Resources</h2>

<p>Climate change may disrupt the stability of water resources at local, regional, and national scales. Three key impacts are described in this section.</p>

<h3>1. Reduced Water Supplies</h3>










<figure class="figure  figure--image figure--small   u-align-right"><div class="figure__media">

    <img srcset="/system/files/styles/small/private/images/2022-10/Picture2.jpg?itok=tZ0AX5u2 320w, /system/files/styles/medium/private/images/2022-10/Picture2.jpg?itok=EFjHjTeL 640w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) calc(100vw - 2rem), 320px" src="/system/files/styles/small/private/images/2022-10/Picture2.jpg?itok=tZ0AX5u2" width="320" height="213" alt="Shasta Lake at a very low level with dry bathtub rings visible." loading="lazy"></div>

      <figcaption class="figure__caption"><em>A lack of snowmelt combined with drought caused low water levels in Shasta Lake, California, in 2021.<a href="#7foot">7</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>In many areas of the country, climate change is likely to increase people’s demand for water while also shrinking water supplies. In mountainous and cold-weather regions, many people depend on snowpack for drinking water, agriculture, and other uses. “Snowpack” refers to the layers of snow that accumulate over long periods of cold weather. As it melts, snowpack feeds into streams and becomes an important freshwater resource.</p>

<p>In the West, warmer temperatures and changes in precipitation are <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d82a6a1e-c5ec-46cf-8ade-114f82dea8a2" href="/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-snowpack">reducing snowpack</a>.<sup><a href="#3foot">3</a></sup> In some areas, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0a2aa022-da47-4460-9d36-afa49b8ea4b3" href="/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-snowfall">less snow is falling</a>, as more precipitation is falling as rain rather than snow.<sup><a href="#4foot">4</a>, <a href="#5foot">5</a></sup> Higher temperatures are also causing snowpack to melt earlier.<sup><a href="#6foot">6</a></sup> All of these changes affect when and how much water is available.</p>

<p><em>Photo caption endnote:</em><sup><a href="#7foot">7</a></sup></p>

<p>Even without the impacts of climate change, the United States’ water supply has begun to diminish.<sup><a href="#8foot">8</a></sup> Much of our water supply comes from groundwater held in underground formations called <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/aquifers-and-groundwater" data-once="external-links protected-links">aquifers<svg class="icon icon--exit is-spaced-before" role="img"><title>Exit EPA’s website</title><use href="/themes/epa_theme/images/sprite.svg#launch"></use></svg></a>. In some parts of the nation, increased demand for water has led to pumping groundwater from aquifers faster than they can be naturally refilled. Persistent droughts in some areas are accelerating this decline.<sup><a href="#9foot">9</a></sup> Warming temperatures from climate change may increase the chance of droughts, especially in the West.<sup><a href="#10foot">10</a></sup></p>

<h3>2. Impaired Water Quality</h3>

<p>Climate change is expected to harm water quality. For example, increased rainfall can lead to more runoff of sediments, nutrients, pathogens, and other substances into water bodies.

These algal blooms can kill fish, shellfish, and other animals. They can also make drinking and recreational water sources unsafe for people and pets.</p>

<p>Climate change threatens to increase the salinity of water bodies and groundwater through <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="231c4418-3b31-40ba-842f-593377ee6409" href="/arc-x/climate-adaptation-and-saltwater-intrusion">saltwater intrusion</a>.<sup><a href="#11foot">11</a></sup> Rising sea level and increased drought can enable saline water to advance farther upstream and inland in estuaries, wetlands, and aquifers. Higher salinity can contaminate freshwater supplies and harm aquatic plants and animals. These impacts are especially likely to happen in low-lying areas such as Louisiana, Florida, and portions of California and the mid-Atlantic.</p>

  <h2 id="economy">Freshwater Resources and the Economy</h2>

<p>The United States uses water to grow crops, raise livestock, produce energy, manufacture and distribute goods, and support many other parts of the economy. Nationwide, healthy <a href="/trinationalanalysis/watersheds">watersheds</a> also provide millions of jobs as well as revenues in tourism, recreation, fishing, and other industries.<sup><a href="#16foot">16</a></sup></p>

<p>In addition, watersheds provide a host of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1b649ca7-ef9e-4e3a-aaed-61c1883b0275" href="/hwp/benefits-healthy-watersheds#:~:text=Healthy%20watersheds%20provide%20many%20ecosystem,recreation%2C%20as%20well%20as%20reduced">ecosystem services</a>. These beneficial services are the free work that communities do not have to do, or pay for, themselves. While it can be hard to put a dollar value on these services, they provide tremendous benefits to society. Among these benefits are water filtration and storage, soil formation, carbon storage, flood control, erosion control, and recreation. Watersheds also function as critical <a href="https://www.fws.gov/story/wildlife-corridors" data-once="external-links protected-links">wildlife corridors<svg class="icon icon--exit is-spaced-before" role="img"><title>Exit EPA’s website</title><use href="/themes/epa_theme/images/sprite.svg#launch"></use></svg></a>, providing passage for animals during their life cycles.</p>

<p>Clean water is also essential to human health. Water utilities spend more than $109 billion each year to provide safe drinking water and wastewater services in the communities they serve.<sup><a href="#17foot">17</a></sup> Nonetheless, more than 7 million people get sick from diseases spread through water each year.<sup><a href="#18foot">18</a></sup> These illnesses cost the U.S. health care system more than $3 billion annually, and climate impacts are expected to increase risk of exposure to water-borne pathogens and water-treatment expenses.<sup><a href="#19foot">19</a>, <a href="#20foot">20</a>, <a href="#21foot">21</a></sup></p>























  <h2 id="justice">Environmental Justice and Equity</h2>

<p>Certain groups of people in the United States, including Indigenous communities, low-income communities, communities on the U.S.–Mexico border, migrant farm workers, and others lack access to clean water and sanitation services.<sup><a href="#22foot">22</a></sup> Climate impacts will compound this situation.</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The U.S. energy system consists of all the infrastructure needed to collect, produce, distribute, store, and consume power for our homes, for our businesses, and while we are on the go.

<p>Our energy system is vulnerable to a wide range of climate change impacts. These include rising temperatures and heat waves, cold and snow events, severe drought, intense rainfall, sea level rise, hurricanes, and wildfires. While these impacts differ from one region to another, they will continue to affect all areas of the country.<sup><a href="#1foot">1</a></sup> Moreover, impacts to one part of the energy system or in one region can affect other parts of the system or other areas.</p>

<h2 class="box__title">The Link Between Energy and Climate Change</h2>

<div class="box__content">
<p>The energy sector is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. In turn, changes in climate can disrupt energy networks themselves, stress infrastructure, and pose safety risks to people. Read more about greenhouse gas emissions on the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6f795146-f319-4a93-a328-239918e07983" href="/climatechange-science/basics-climate-change">Basics of Climate Change</a> page.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>In addition, energy interacts with and depends on other sectors of the economy, such as <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c3ae7f3f-b1bc-459f-9bd7-760b380db060" href="/climateimpacts/climate-change-impacts-freshwater-resources">water resources</a>&nbsp;and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="52353eb3-7381-45be-97dd-2e580e232461" href="/climateimpacts/climate-change-impacts-transportation">transportation</a>. Therefore, climate impacts on these sectors can affect the energy system.</span></p>

<p><span>Businesses, governments, and others are taking many actions to increase the resiliency of the energy system to climate change. For example, many states are upgrading and protecting their energy infrastructure from extreme weather.<sup><a href="#2foot">2</a></sup> Governments and businesses are sharing information with each other through private/public partnerships. Companies and researchers are developing and installing innovative and renewable technologies (such as wind and solar) that help reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. These actions not only help address vulnerabilities to the energy system, but also reduce the emissions that are making climate change worse.</span></p>

  <h2><a id="impacts" name="impacts" data-once="external-links protected-links"></a><a id="top" name="top" data-once="external-links protected-links"></a>Top Climate Impacts on Energy</h2>

<p>Climate change may affect the energy sector at both local and regional scales. Four key impacts are described in this section.</p>

<h3>1. Disruptions to Energy Supply</h3>










<figure class="figure  figure--image figure--small   u-align-right"><div class="figure__media">

    <img srcset="/system/files/styles/small/private/images/2022-11/iStock-175190393-v2.jpg?itok=HUSwiyjp 320w, /system/files/styles/medium/private/images/2022-11/iStock-175190393-v2.jpg?itok=SW6H7m3A 640w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) calc(100vw - 2rem), 320px" src="/system/files/styles/small/private/images/2022-11/iStock-175190393-v2.jpg?itok=HUSwiyjp" width="320" height="204" alt="Tree and powerlines down in road" loading="lazy"></div>

      <figcaption class="figure__caption">Superstorm Sandy caused 8.7 million customers to lose power in 2012. Source: USGCRP, <a href="https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/downloads/NCA4_Ch04_Energy_Full.pdf" data-once="external-links protected-links">Fourth National Climate Assessment<svg class="icon icon--exit is-spaced-before" role="img"><title>Exit EPA’s website</title><use href="/themes/epa_theme/images/sprite.svg#launch"></use></svg></a>, 2018.</figcaption></figure><p>Extreme weather and natural disasters pose significant risks to the U.S. energy supply in all regions of the country.<sup><a href="#3foot">3</a></sup> Energy systems on both the Gulf and East Coasts face more risk of damage from flooding due to hurricanes and sea level rise.<sup><a href="#4foot">4</a></sup> More frequent and intense precipitation events are expected to increase the risk of flooding on infrastructure in the Northeast and the Midwest.<sup><a href="#5foot">5</a></sup>&nbsp;In Arctic regions like Alaska, thawing permafrost causes land to sink and compromise fuel pipelines and other energy infrastructure.<sup><a href="#6foot">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Overall, the climate is warming, and the atmosphere’s increasing capacity to hold moisture can lead to longer periods without rainfall. The warmth and variability in precipitation can lead to declining snowpack, shifts in snowmelt, and extended droughts—all of which affect water supplies needed for energy systems. For example, most U.S. power plants depend on rivers or lakes for cooling.<sup><a href="#7foot">7</a></sup> Petroleum, natural gas, and biofuels production and refining also require a steady supply of water.<sup><a href="#8foot">8</a></sup> Water shortages have already affected hydropower production, especially in the West.<sup><a href="#9foot">9</a></sup> Without enough water, affected systems need to find new water sources or scale back their operations.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>2. Interruptions to Electricity Transmission</h3>

<p>Climate change threatens the ways in which power reaches our homes and businesses.<sup><a href="#10foot">10</a></sup> For example, transmission lines are prone to damage during extreme weather. Snow and ice, wildfires, and extreme wind can damage above-ground powerlines and transmission towers.<sup><a href="#11foot">11</a></sup> Flooding can affect underground powerlines and damage roads, railroads, pipelines, and storage facilities.<sup><a href="#12foot">12</a></sup> Near the coast, storm surge can destroy petroleum storage tanks and wash out roads and railways.<sup><a href="#13foot">13</a></sup></p>

<p>Warmer temperatures, especially hot summer temperatures, can affect power transmission. When temperatures rise, the carrying capacity of transmission lines decreases.<sup><a href="#14foot">14</a></sup> Summer months also present more wildfire risks, especially in the Southwest.<sup><a href="#15foot">15</a></sup> Wildfires can disrupt energy networks significantly when they affect transmission towers and powerlines.<sup><a href="#16foot">16</a>,<a href="#17foot">17</a></sup> In some areas, faulty or fallen powerlines (or lines that come in contact with trees) can start wildfires. This risk is why some utilities shut down powerlines when high winds are forecast.<sup><a href="#18foot">18</a></sup></p>

<h3>3. Strain on the Energy System</h3>

<p>A warming climate also means that Americans are expected to use less energy for heating their homes in the winter.<sup><a href="#22foot">22</a></sup> However, increased summer demands for cooling are expected to outweigh any energy-use reductions from lower heating needs.<sup><a href="#23foot">23</a></sup></p>

<h3>4. Increased Air Pollution and Climate Change</h3>

<p>As the demand for cooling increases across the nation, more electricity must be produced to meet this demand. Increasing energy production is likely to increase emissions of certain air pollutants and <a href="/climatechange-science/causes-climate-change#greenhousegas">greenhouse gases</a> that contribute to climate change.<sup><a href="#24foot">24</a>,<a href="#25foot">25</a></sup></p>

Fossil fuels (petroleum, coal, and natural gas) accounted for nearly 80% of U.S. energy production—both electricity generation and energy consumed directly—in 2020. The primary consumer sectors of energy in the United States are the industrial, transportation, commercial, and residential sectors.</p>

<p>The energy system is an important source of employment for Americans, providing jobs for about 5.2 million people.<sup><a href="#28foot">28</a></sup> These jobs support power generation and transmission, fuel extraction and processing, and renewable energy and energy-efficiency installations and sales.</p>

<p>U.S. energy exports also contribute to the economy. In 2020, U.S. energy exports exceeded total energy imports, as the United States was a net exporter of petroleum products, natural gas, and coal.<sup><a href="#29foot">29</a></sup> Crude oil was the only major fuel type for which the United States was a net importer.<sup><a href="#30foot">30</a></sup></p>

<p>Major disturbances to the energy supply, such as power outages or fuel shortages, harm the economy.<sup><a href="#31foot">31</a></sup> For example, energy disruptions from extreme weather damage to energy infrastructure have cost billions of dollars.<sup><a href="#32foot">32</a></sup> The nation’s energy system is also aging, with many components not designed to withstand the extreme weather conditions projected for this century.<sup><a href="#33foot">33</a></sup></p>

      <figcaption class="figure__caption">One study found that one U.S. household in three faces challenges paying its energy bills.<a href="#40foot">40</a></figcaption></figure><p>Some communities have been historically overburdened by pollution. Low-income people, people of color, and linguistically isolated communities are more likely than the national average to <a href="/airmarkets/power-plants-and-neighboring-communities">live near power plants that burn fossil fuels</a>.<sup><a href="#35foot">35</a></sup> This means they can be exposed to air pollutants that cause or contribute to health issues, such as respiratory and heart diseases.<sup><a href="#36foot">36</a></sup> As the climate changes and energy demand grows, communities may face increased levels of these emissions and associated risks.</p>

<p>Lower-income communities also carry a higher energy burden than those with higher incomes. On average, low-income households spend 8.6% of their income on energy expenses.<sup><a href="#37foot">37</a></sup> In comparison, non-low-income households spend 3%.<sup><a href="#38foot">38</a></sup> Many factors contribute to this burden. For example, low-income households may live in housing without insulation or with outdated appliances.<sup><a href="#39foot">39</a></sup> This energy burden may increase as the climate changes and energy demand goes up.</p>

<p>In addition, low-income communities often face barriers to accessing clean technologies that make energy more affordable. For instance, as of 2018, less than half of community-scale solar projects included households with lower incomes.<sup><a href="#41foot">41</a></sup></p>

  </figure><p>We can reduce climate change’s impact on the energy sector in many ways, including the following:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Save energy. </strong>Individuals and companies can take many <a href="/climate-change/what-you-can-do-about-climate-change-energy">actions</a> to save energy. For example, look for <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/products" data-once="external-links protected-links">ENERGY STAR certified products</a>, such as appliances and electronics. Some utility companies even offer <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/about/federal_tax_credits" data-once="external-links protected-links">federal tax credits</a>.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Expand access to clean technologies. </strong>Government and industry leaders can help expand access to <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/energy-related-federal-financial-assistance-programs" data-once="external-links protected-links">renewable energy programs<svg class="icon icon--exit is-spaced-before" role="img"><title>Exit EPA’s website</title><use href="/themes/epa_theme/images/sprite.svg#launch"></use></svg></a>, such as wind and solar power, so that all communities benefit. This transition will help reduce the emissions contributing to climate change.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Modernize infrastructure. </strong>Utilities and government agencies can update energy infrastructure, such as leak-prone pipelines and <a href="https://www.energy.gov/oe/activities/technology-development/grid-modernization-and-smart-grid" data-once="external-links protected-links">aging power lines<svg class="icon icon--exit is-spaced-before" role="img"><title>Exit EPA’s website</title><use href="/themes/epa_theme/images/sprite.svg#launch"></use></svg></a>.

  <p>People are taking many actions to help ecosystems adapt to climate change impacts or minimize the effects. For example, federal agencies that manage the nation’s natural resources are now considering climate change in polices and planning. At the local level, many groups are preserving habitats and restoring ecosystems that have been damaged or disturbed in the past.</p>

  </figure><p>Ecosystems provide many benefits to people. These are called <a href="/eco-research/ecosystem-services">ecosystem services</a>. Ecosystem services include goods from plants and animals, such as the food and wood provided by trees. They also include parts of the physical world that keep the planet safe and healthy. For example, clean lakes and streams are considered ecosystem services because we use them for drinking water and recreation.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a id="top" name="top" data-once="external-links protected-links"></a><a id="impacts" name="impacts" data-once="external-links protected-links"></a>Top Climate Impacts on Ecosystems</h2>

<p>Climate change affects ecosystems at multiple levels, from the populations that make up ecosystems to the services they provide to communities, economies, and people. Four key impacts are described in this section.</p>

<h3>1. Changes in Species and Populations</h3>










<figure class="figure  figure--image figure--small   u-align-right"><div class="figure__media">

    <img srcset="/system/files/styles/small/private/images/2022-11/iStock-1204272723-v2.jpg?itok=wCyUQOYO 320w, /system/files/styles/medium/private/images/2022-11/iStock-1204272723-v2.jpg?itok=XOWYfIuy 640w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) calc(100vw - 2rem), 320px" src="/system/files/styles/small/private/images/2022-11/iStock-1204272723-v2.jpg?itok=wCyUQOYO" width="320" height="240" alt="Moose in wooded area" loading="lazy"></div>

      <figcaption class="figure__caption">On Isle Royale, an island in Lake Superior, warming has reduced wolves’ ability to survive, which has led to an increase in moose populations.<a href="#9foot">9</a></figcaption></figure><p>As the climate changes, some species will adapt by changing their behavior, physical characteristics, or how their bodies function. Others will not be able to adapt. As a result, climate change could lead to expansions, reductions, or extinctions of some populations. These changes, in turn, can affect the overall <a href="/report-environment/diversity-and-biological-balance">biodiversity</a> of a region.</p>

<p>Plants and animals may also change the geographic range they inhabit in response to changing climatic conditions. Changing temperature and water conditions have already altered the ranges of many plants and animals.<sup><a href="#6foot">6</a></sup> As temperatures have warmed in the United States, some land animals have moved to the (typically cooler) north by an average of 3.8 miles per decade.<sup><a href="#7foot">7</a></sup> Some marine species have also shifted north by more than 17 miles per decade.<sup><a href="#8foot">8</a></sup></p>

<h3>2. Changes in the Timing of Natural Events and Cycles</h3>

<p>Many plants and animals rely on cues in nature, including temperature and water conditions, to trigger certain stages of their life cycles. As the climate changes, these cues can change at different rates, or potentially not all. As a result, species that depend on one another at certain times of the year may no longer be in sync.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, plankton are an important food source for young fish, but they tend to react more quickly to changes in temperature than the fish. This means the plankton might not be as available when growing fish need it most. Also, if a bird migrates at the same time each year, it could reach its destination to find that, due to shifting temperatures, its main food source grew too early and is no longer available.<sup><a href="#10foot">10</a></sup></p>

      <figcaption class="figure__caption">Explore the many ways in which a changing physical environment affects ecosystems and the living things that live in them. EPA’s <em><a href="/climate-indicators/seasonality-and-climate-change">Seasonality and Climate Change</a></em> report walks through four main themes threatening ecosystems in the United States.</figcaption></figure><h3>3. Changes in Ecosystem Interactions</h3>

<p>Climate change is also changing the way species and populations interact with the environment and one another. These impacts can be felt throughout an entire ecosystem.</p>

<p>For example, climate change is increasing the spread of <a href="https://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/" data-once="external-links protected-links">invasive species<svg class="icon icon--exit is-spaced-before" role="img"><title>Exit EPA’s website</title><use href="/themes/epa_theme/images/sprite.svg#launch"></use></svg></a> in some areas.<sup><a href="#11foot">11</a></sup> An invasive species is one that is not native to an area. Invasive species can outcompete native plants and animals, bring in new diseases, and cause other problems. These changes can create significant environmental and economic harm.</p>

<p>As ocean water warms, invasive fish species, such as the tropical <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/southeast/ecosystems/impacts-invasive-lionfish" data-once="external-links protected-links">lionfish<svg class="icon icon--exit is-spaced-before" role="img"><title>Exit EPA’s website</title><use href="/themes/epa_theme/images/sprite.svg#launch"></use></svg></a>, are expected to move north along the Atlantic coast, threatening native species.<sup><a href="#12foot">12</a></sup> This can also hurt humans, as lionfish are venomous and can sting people.</p>

<p>Climate change can also affect food webs. A food web is the whole set of feeding relationships among different organisms in an ecosystem. At the bottom of a food web are organisms like plants and plankton. Other animals, higher in the web, rely on them as food sources. Climate impacts on any part of a food web can affect the whole system, and even other ecosystems altogether. From the example above, if young fish cannot find enough food in the estuaries, their predators in the ocean could feel the effects as well.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>4. Altered or Reduced Ecosystem Services</h3>

<p>Climate change can also affect ecosystem services such as carbon capture and storage. <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="89f8e89b-2358-4770-9cf7-e3acba595402" href="/climateimpacts/climate-change-impacts-forests">Forest ecosystems</a> play a critical role in the carbon cycle, helping to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in roots, soil, and the forest floor.<sup><a href="#15foot">15</a></sup> But climate-driven increases in wildfires, flooding, pests, and diseases can limit the ability of an ecosystem to provide this important service.<sup><a href="#16foot">16</a></sup></p>

<h2><a id="economy" name="economy" data-once="external-links protected-links"></a>Ecosystems and the Economy</h2>

<p>Ecosystems and their benefits—often referred to as ecosystem services—support key aspects of human existence. As a result, they are the foundation to large parts of the economy. Globally, ecosystem services are worth an estimated $125 to $145 trillion per year.<sup><a href="#17foot">17</a></sup></p>

  <h2 id="what">What We Can Do</h2>

<p>We can limit climate change’s impacts on ecosystems in several ways, including the following:</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>

<p>U.S. coasts span the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic oceans as well as the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. When including the coast of the Great Lakes, more than 128 million people live in coastal counties.<sup><a href="#1foot">1</a></sup> Coastal ecosystems support many industries, provide recreational opportunities, and protect communities from storms. Coasts are also important to global trade and in providing job opportunities.</p>

  <p>U.S. coastal counties face permanent inundation and flooding threats from sea level rise, intense rains, high tide flooding, and severe storms. It is likely that hurricane intensity has also increased over the past four decades.<sup><a href="#2foot">2</a></sup> Scientists project that as the climate warms, there will be more intense hurricanes as well as increased rainfall.<sup><a href="#3foot">3</a></sup> Although there is uncertainty about where, when, and how much sea level will rise, scientists are highly confident there will be significant impacts on coastal communities even at lower-end estimates.<sup><a href="#4foot">4</a></sup> Other climate threats to coasts include ocean acidification, harmful algal blooms, and saltwater intrusion.</p>

<p>Many communities are taking steps to protect coasts from climate change. For example, some communities are elevating buildings or constructing barriers to shield people, businesses, and property from flooding and storm surge.<sup><a href="#5foot">5</a>,<a href="#6foot">6</a></sup> Others are restoring coastal habitats and using nature-based features to build coastal resilience. Many coastal cities and counties are focusing on land use planning to encourage smart growth and reduce the impacts of climate change. Yet, elsewhere, communities are relocating entirely; members of the Isle de Jean Charles Band of the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Tribe are planning to resettle inland after losing 98% of their tribal lands to rising seas.<sup><a href="#7foot">7</a>, <a href="#8foot">8</a></sup></p>

  <h2 id="top"><a id="impacts" name="impacts" data-once="external-links protected-links"></a><a id="top" name="top" data-once="external-links protected-links"></a>Top Climate Impacts on Coasts</h2>

<p>The effects of climate change on the nation’s coasts have been observed for decades. Three key impacts of climate change are described in this section.</p>

<h3>1. Coastal Property and Infrastructure</h3>

<p>A growing concentration of people live in the nation’s coastal areas. In fact, while coastal counties make up only 10% of the nation’s land mass (excluding Alaska), they are home to 40% of the population. Climate change impacts to coastal communities affect not only human health, but also properties, infrastructure, and services.</p>










<figure class="figure  figure--image figure--small   u-align-right"><div class="figure__media">

    <img srcset="/system/files/styles/small/private/images/2022-07/Coasts%20Picture2.png?itok=TUUGvB4g 320w, /system/files/styles/medium/private/images/2022-07/Coasts%20Picture2.png?itok=3mzQ41h3 605w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) calc(100vw - 2rem), 320px" src="/system/files/styles/small/private/images/2022-07/Coasts%20Picture2.png?itok=TUUGvB4g" width="320" height="240" alt="" loading="lazy"></div>

      <figcaption class="figure__caption">U.S. coasts are home to trillions of dollars' worth of real estate.<a href="#12foot">12</a></figcaption></figure><p>More than $1 trillion worth of property is located within 700 feet of the coast.<sup><a href="#9foot">9</a></sup> These properties’ proximity to water bodies may put them at risk of extreme weather events, hurricanes, sea level rise, and high tide flooding.<sup><a href="#10foot">10</a></sup> These threats can damage or destroy property or make real estate uninhabitable. In turn, property losses potentially affect local economies by shuttering brick-and-mortar businesses, lowering tax revenues, and diverting resources from public services. Losing a home or business may also cause mental health impacts, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder.<sup><a href="#11foot">11</a></sup></p>

<p>In addition to homes and businesses, critical coastal infrastructure is also at risk. The nation’s coasts are home to many military bases, airports, power plants, oil refining facilities, and other infrastructure. More than 60,000 miles of roads and bridges are located in U.S. coastal floodplains.<sup><a href="#13foot">13</a></sup>&nbsp;Increased flooding of roads and bridges can delay or disrupt <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="52353eb3-7381-45be-97dd-2e580e232461" href="/climateimpacts/climate-change-impacts-transportation">transportation</a>, affecting peoples’ everyday routines, including their ability get to work or school, obtain food and supplies, and receive medical care. Increased flooding can also affect emergency preparedness and response efforts.</p>

<h3>2. Coastal Ecosystems</h3>










<figure class="figure  figure--image figure--small   u-align-right"><div class="figure__media">

    <img srcset="/system/files/styles/small/private/images/2022-07/Coasts%20Picture3.png?itok=XAiLT67z 320w, /system/files/styles/medium/private/images/2022-07/Coasts%20Picture3.png?itok=I5wklEZp 640w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) calc(100vw - 2rem), 320px" src="/system/files/styles/small/private/images/2022-07/Coasts%20Picture3.png?itok=XAiLT67z" width="320" height="213" alt="Louisiana swampland with mangroves" loading="lazy"></div>

      <figcaption class="figure__caption">Coastal wetlands are found along the Atlantic, Pacific, Alaskan, and Gulf Coasts. Mangrove swamps are one type of wetland.<a href="#21foot">21</a></figcaption></figure><p>The nation’s coasts include a wide range of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="62ddbaa2-85c3-4665-8b71-d5cd0aec7f4a" href="/climateimpacts/climate-change-impacts-ecosystems">ecosystems</a>, such as estuaries, deltas, mangroves, marshes, beaches, and reefs. These ecosystems provide recreational opportunities and support tourism, fishing, and many other industries. They also are home to diverse species of wildlife. In addition, healthy coastal watersheds provide other benefits to society, such as improving water quality and storing carbon.</p>

<p>Some coastal ecosystems are already affected by rising temperatures, sea level rise, and extreme weather events.<sup><a href="#14foot">14</a></sup> In addition, in a number of places nationwide, there are large <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/deadzone.html" data-once="external-links protected-links">dead zones<svg class="icon icon--exit is-spaced-before" role="img"><title>Exit EPA’s website</title><use href="/themes/epa_theme/images/sprite.svg#launch"></use></svg></a> where marine life cannot live. In these areas, nutrient runoff indirectly causes low oxygen levels in the water. As a result, these vast stretches of open water experience die-offs of fish, shellfish, corals, and aquatic plants. These zones are expected to increase in number and size as the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d0f0b995-d472-4806-ae14-e22a5201deff" href="/climateimpacts/climate-change-impacts-ocean-and-marine-resources">ocean</a> warms and heavier rains wash more nutrient-laden runoff into coastal waters.<sup><a href="#15foot">15</a></sup></p>

<p>Climate change can also contribute to <a href="/arc-x/climate-adaptation-and-saltwater-intrusion#:~:text=Sea%2Dlevel%20rise%2C%20in%20combination,or%20render%20groundwater%20wells%20unusable.">saltwater intrusion</a>.<sup><a href="#16foot">16</a></sup> Rising sea level and increased drought can enable saline water to advance further upstream and inland in estuaries, wetlands, and aquifers.<sup><a href="#17foot">17</a></sup> Higher salinity can contaminate freshwater supplies and threaten some aquatic plants and animals.</p>

<p>In addition, rising sea levels and more extreme weather can increase the extent to which storm surge and high tides can cause saltwater to infiltrate low-lying areas and groundwater, which harms agriculture or drinking water supplies.</p>

<h3>3. Land Losses</h3>

<p>Climate change is contributing to coastal land losses, especially on the Gulf Coast.<sup><a href="#18foot">18</a></sup> Rising sea levels can turn dry land into wetlands or open water. Existing wetlands can also be at risk. From 1932 to 2016, Louisiana lost more than 2,000 square miles of land area, mostly wetlands, in part due to rising sea levels.<sup><a href="#19foot">19</a></sup></p>

<p>The loss of coastal land can have a direct impact on both the immediate environment and surrounding communities. Coastal wetlands in particular play an important role in providing habitats for fish and birds and in attenuating coastal storm impacts. As a carbon sink, wetlands help mitigate climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. When wetlands are lost, their ability to store carbon is also reduced.<sup><a href="#20foot">20</a></sup> In addition, wetlands defend communities from erosion, waves, flooding, and storm surge.</p>

      <figcaption class="figure__caption">If our coastal counties were a country, they would rank third in the world in gross domestic product.<a href="#24foot">24</a></figcaption></figure><p>The nation’s coasts are essential to local, national, and global economies. Coastal counties produce more than $9.5 trillion in goods and services each year.<sup><a href="#22foot">22</a></sup> Communities on the coasts also support more than 58 million jobs in the fishing, tourism, real estate, defense, and other industries.<sup><a href="#23foot">23</a></sup></p>

<p>Most of the goods in our stores arrive through the nation’s marine transportation system.<sup><a href="#25foot">25</a></sup> In fact, more than three-fourths of all trade involves marine transportation.<sup><a href="#26foot">26</a></sup></p>

<p>Damage to the coasts, such as from hurricanes and flooding, has negative impacts on the economy. In addition to property damage and cleanup costs, interruptions can occur in business operations and community services. Disruptions can also extend far beyond an affected area to transportation routes, energy distribution, and supply chains. Hurricane Katrina is the costliest hurricane on record, incurring damages totaling $182.5 billion in 2021 dollars.<sup><a href="#27foot">27</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>

      <figcaption class="figure__caption">An EPA study found that Hispanic and Latino people are 50% more likely than others to live in coastal areas with the highest projected increases in traffic delays from high tide flooding.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Climate change is expected to worsen existing inequities affecting <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4dd03b1e-aa03-462c-bd98-6eac68fe3014" href="/climateimpacts/climate-change-and-health-socially-vulnerable-people">socially vulnerable populations</a>&nbsp;in coastal areas. These underserved populations span many regions and groups, from the elderly in Florida to rural coastal communities to Indigenous fishing communities of Alaska. Extreme weather events have highlighted how some of these groups face heightened risks as the climate changes. For example, a disproportionate number of flood-related deaths from Hurricane Katrina were older adults.<a href="#28foot"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<p>Not everyone will be able to prepare for or respond equally to climate change threats in coastal areas. Climate impacts may force people to elevate their homes or move. However, some people may not be able to afford to improve their homes and may be forced to move. Others may be unwilling or unable to move and may endure increasing damages. Renters, low-income households, those who face language barriers, and others may find it difficult to voice their opinions or take immediate action to preserve their home or community. In some areas, protective infrastructure might be prioritized for higher-density areas at the expense of leaving rural residents more exposed.</p>

  <h2 id="what">What We Can Do</h2>

<p>Organizations, communities, land managers, and others can take many actions to reduce the impacts of climate change on U.S. coasts, including the following:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Identify the risks.</strong> Identifying coastal risks is the first step to managing them. EPA’s Climate Ready Estuaries program has <a href="/cre/risk-based-adaptation">resources</a> to help coastal managers assess their risks.</li>
	<li><strong>Work with nature.</strong> Communities can use nature-based solutions like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="61384927-31aa-4e41-9703-47f4847fefd3" href="/green-infrastructure/coastal-resiliency">living shorelines</a>, green spaces, and sand dunes, to help reduce the impacts of storm surge, coastal flooding, and erosion.</li>
	<li><strong>Involve diverse stakeholders.</strong> Community planners can ensure all residents have a voice in coastal resilience planning, including those <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="72fe9d46-ac12-4eab-a313-a8e29065d90c" href="/climateimpacts/climate-change-and-human-health-whos-most-risk">most vulnerable to climate impacts</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Know if you are in a flood zone.</strong> Learn about your <a href="https://www.floodsmart.gov/understanding-my-flood-zone" data-once="external-links protected-links">flood risk<svg class="icon icon--exit is-spaced-before" role="img"><title>Exit EPA’s website</title><use href="/themes/epa_theme/images/sprite.svg#launch"></use></svg></a> and the insurance protection your home needs.</li>
	<li><strong>Celebrate wetlands.</strong> There are many ways you can <a href="https://www.fws.gov/program/national-wetlands-inventory/get-involved" data-once="external-links protected-links">help protect wetlands<svg class="icon icon--exit is-spaced-before" role="img"><title>Exit EPA’s website</title><use href="/themes/epa_theme/images/sprite.svg#launch"></use></svg></a>.

  <h2>Overview</h2>

<p><span>The <a href="/smm/basic-information-about-built-environment">built environment</a> includes structures and systems that provide places for people to live, work, and play. It includes buildings, roads, bridges, parks, streets, and systems that provide transportation, water, power, and more. These structures and systems exist in nearly all places where people live and work, but tend to be most concentrated in metropolitan areas. About 85% of Americans live in metropolitan areas, and that number is projected to grow over the next 100 years.<sup><a href="#1foot">1</a></sup></span></p>

      <figcaption class="figure__caption">Green roofs provide shade, remove heat from the air, and provide many other benefits in urban areas.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p><span>Climate change affects cities differently depending on their location. Many cities are already dealing with multiple impacts from climate change. For example, some experience more frequent and longer heat waves.<sup><a href="#2foot">2</a></sup> Those impacts worsen the temperature problems caused by <a href="/heatislands">urban heat islands</a>—that is, city areas with higher temperatures than outlying areas.<sup><a href="#3foot">3</a></sup> At the same time, some urban areas are experiencing repeated flooding from heavy rains that overwhelm drainage systems. Others face flooding problems due to losses of wetlands and forests that once absorbed rainfall.<sup><a href="#4foot">4</a></sup></span></p>

<p><span>In addition, the built environment interacts with and depends on other sectors of the economy, such as <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c3ae7f3f-b1bc-459f-9bd7-760b380db060" href="/climateimpacts/climate-change-impacts-freshwater-resources">water</a>, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="52353eb3-7381-45be-97dd-2e580e232461" href="/climateimpacts/climate-change-impacts-transportation">transportation</a>, and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5b404daa-f057-4563-b7fa-7d3fb3cd9a99" href="/climateimpacts/climate-change-impacts-energy">energy </a>. So, climate impacts on these sectors can also affect the built environment</span><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>Cities are taking steps to adapt to climate change. These actions are helping to protect the built environment, improve land-use planning, and increase emergency preparedness. For example, many cities are planting trees, installing green roofs, and adding green spaces. These measures help improve air quality and cool urban areas. More permeable ground cover also absorbs rainfall, reducing runoff and flooding. Some governments are using policy measures, like building codes and zoning laws, to protect the built environment and city residents from climate change.<sup><a href="#5foot">5</a></sup></span></p>

<p>Climate change has multiple effects on the built environment. Three key impacts are described in this section.</p>

<h3>1. Damaged or Stressed Infrastructure</h3>










<figure class="figure  figure--image figure--small   u-align-right"><div class="figure__media">

    <img srcset="/system/files/styles/small/private/images/2022-11/iStock-1060148592-v2.jpg?itok=u8zO0qMa 320w, /system/files/styles/medium/private/images/2022-11/iStock-1060148592-v2.jpg?itok=28IvUU9M 640w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) calc(100vw - 2rem), 320px" src="/system/files/styles/small/private/images/2022-11/iStock-1060148592-v2.jpg?itok=u8zO0qMa" width="320" height="213" alt="Crumbling bridge" loading="lazy"></div>

      <figcaption class="figure__caption">Most of the U.S. built environment was not designed with climate change in mind and is vulnerable to climate change.<a href="#12foot">12</a></figcaption></figure><p>A lot of U.S. infrastructure is nearing the end of its life. This aging infrastructure is threatened by extreme weather events—some of which are already becoming more frequent and/or more intense.<sup><a href="#7foot">7</a></sup></p>

<p>Climate change impacts on infrastructure vary by region. For example, in coastal regions, high tide flooding has harmed or destroyed infrastructure and private property.<sup><a href="#8foot">8</a></sup> In the West, wildfires are already damaging property and affecting air quality.<sup><a href="#9foot">9</a></sup> In floodplains across the nation, extreme precipitation can cause dam failures, bridge washouts, and road closures.<sup><a href="#10foot">10</a></sup> Many cities also have outdated or aging sewer systems that intense rainfall can overwhelm, causing untreated wastewater to flow into local water bodies.<sup><a href="#11foot">11</a></sup></p>

<p>Extreme temperatures can also stress the U.S. energy system.<sup><a href="#13foot">13</a></sup> Failing cooling systems can lead to high indoor temperatures that endanger <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="efda92b1-ad88-40ef-8bea-673018fed4c8" href="/climateimpacts/climate-change-and-health-workers">workers' health</a>&nbsp;and reduce productivity.<sup><a href="#14foot">14</a></sup> Transportation systems are also vulnerable to multiple climate change stressors, including extreme temperatures and heavy precipitation.<sup><a href="#15foot">15</a></sup> For example, flooding from extreme precipitation can cause billions of dollars of damage to transportation infrastructure in a single year.<sup><a href="#16foot">16</a></sup> Meanwhile, high temperatures can stress bridge integrity and weaken rail systems.<sup><a href="#17foot">17</a></sup></p>

<h3>2. Impacts on the Production and Distribution of Goods and Services</h3>










<figure class="figure  figure--image figure--small   u-align-right"><div class="figure__media">

    <img srcset="/system/files/styles/small/private/images/2022-11/iStock-852285366.jpg?itok=CIhnojId 320w, /system/files/styles/medium/private/images/2022-11/iStock-852285366.jpg?itok=MLiElMqz 640w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) calc(100vw - 2rem), 320px" src="/system/files/styles/small/private/images/2022-11/iStock-852285366.jpg?itok=CIhnojId" width="320" height="214" alt="Flood damage to walkway" loading="lazy"></div>

      <figcaption class="figure__caption">In Houston, 300,000 customers were without power when Hurricane Harvey struck in 2017. The storm also affected emergency services, hospitals, and water treatment plants.</figcaption></figure><p>Urban centers produce many goods that are important to the economy at local to global scales. Cities also provide many essential services to the public, such as telecommunications, energy, water, health care, and transportation.</p>

<p>A network of interconnected systems supports the flow of these goods and services. Climate change poses multiple and far-reaching risks to these systems.<sup><a href="#18foot">18</a></sup> For example, extreme weather can cause power outages that disrupt transportation, interrupt supply chains, limit communication, and make it difficult for people to access health care.</p>

<h3>3. Threats to Quality of Life and Human Health&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Cities provide access to jobs, education, recreation, arts, culture, and much more. But many cities already face challenges with aging infrastructure, social inequities, and other problems. Climate change can worsen these problems and pose additional risks. For example, climate impacts on <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="41b9aafa-9278-4d67-9272-ba90730b39eb" href="/climateimpacts/climate-change-impacts-air-quality">air quality</a> and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c3ae7f3f-b1bc-459f-9bd7-760b380db060" href="/climateimpacts/climate-change-impacts-freshwater-resources">water quality</a>&nbsp;can affect people’s health. Flooding can force people to evacuate their homes, affecting their mental and physical health. Sea level rise, flooding, and wildfires also threaten some historic landmarks, playgrounds, and cultural sites.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Forests, open spaces, and waterways in urban areas provide a wide range of benefits, but many are stressed due to development, pollution, and invasive species.<sup><a href="#19foot">19</a></sup> These existing challenges can reduce their resilience to climate change effects.<sup><a href="#20foot">20</a></sup></p>

<h2><a id="economy" name="economy" data-once="external-links protected-links"></a><a id="economy" name="economy" data-once="external-links protected-links"></a>The Built Environment and the Economy</h2>

<p>Urban areas are important engines of economic growth—hubs for producing and consuming goods and services. In 2015, urban areas contributed about 91% of the United States’ gross domestic product (GDP). The five largest cities in the country accounted for 23% of the GDP.<sup><a href="#21foot">21</a></sup> In addition, urban lands are worth trillions of dollars.<sup><a href="#22foot">22</a></sup></p>

<p>However, cities also bear the burden of aging and declining infrastructure that needs major financial investments to replace or repair. Not addressing this problem could cost the U.S. GDP up to $3.9 trillion by 2025.<sup><a href="#23foot">23</a></sup> This estimate considers reduced goods production, lost trade, disrupted supply chains, fewer jobs, and lower wages. Services like transportation, water, electricity, and sanitation would also be affected, impacting people’s health and quality of life.&nbsp;<br>

      <figcaption class="figure__caption">Heat can affect children who spend time outdoors playing and exercising.</figcaption></figure><p>Some groups of urban residents are especially vulnerable to climate change impacts on the built environment. For example, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7390866d-232f-4e54-916b-acb3f01e5797" href="/climateimpacts/climate-change-and-childrens-health">children</a>, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="27266ee1-c3d3-45ef-ac2d-9ff01f038ba3" href="/climateimpacts/climate-change-and-health-older-adults">older adults</a>, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="efda92b1-ad88-40ef-8bea-673018fed4c8" href="/climateimpacts/climate-change-and-health-workers">outdoor workers</a>, and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a621321e-ec89-4b48-b61b-f8e46a42d3ad" href="/climateimpacts/climate-change-and-health-people-chronic-medical-conditions">people with some medical conditions</a> are all sensitive to extreme heat.<sup><a href="#24foot">24</a></sup> The urban heat island effect in built-up areas will intensify the effects of extreme heat events and reduce the relief provided by cooler temperatures at night.<sup><a href="#25foot">25</a></sup> People who lack housing or who live in homes without adequate insulation or cooling are also more at risk for heat stress.<sup><a href="#26foot">26</a></sup></p>

<p>In addition, many groups of urban residents live with high levels of air pollution.<sup><a href="#27foot">27</a>,<a href="#28foot">28</a></sup> Black and African American individuals are 34% more likely to live in areas with the highest projected increases in childhood asthma due to climate-related changes in <a href="/pm-pollution">particulate matter</a>.<sup><a href="#29foot">29</a></sup></p>

<p>People who live in buildings that are older or in poor condition can be more exposed to outdoor pollutants and allergens.<sup><a href="#30foot">30</a></sup> These buildings may also sustain more damage during extreme weather, such as storms and floods. This can lead to damp indoor environments prone to mold and bacteria.<sup><a href="#31foot">31</a></sup></p>

<p>Climate change can also affect food security in urban areas.<sup><a href="#32foot">32</a></sup> For example, power outages from extreme weather can cause food spoilage. Climate impacts on <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8f43e313-5b3f-4076-aa72-4f3a33100559" href="/climateimpacts/climate-change-impacts-agriculture-and-food-supply">agriculture</a> and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="52353eb3-7381-45be-97dd-2e580e232461" href="/climateimpacts/climate-change-impacts-transportation">transportation</a> may affect supply chains, food prices, and availability.<sup><a href="#33foot">33</a></sup> People who already have limited access to food will be affected the most. These include households with an income below the poverty threshold, those headed by a single woman, and those with Black or Hispanic owners or lessees.<sup><a href="#34foot">34</a></sup><br>
&nbsp;</p>

























  <h2 id="what">What We Can Do</h2>

<p>We can reduce the impact of climate change on the built environment in many ways, including the following:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Go for the green.</strong> Green roofs, greenways, trees, and other <a href="/green-infrastructure">green infrastructure</a> all help reduce the <a href="/heatislands">urban heat island effect</a> and absorb rainwater to prevent flooding. They also <a href="/green-infrastructure/benefits-green-infrastructure">provide benefits</a> like improved air quality and habitat for wildlife.</li>
	<li><strong>Create climate action plans. </strong>City governments can <a href="/smartgrowth/planning-framework-climate-resilient-economy">develop plans</a> to identify vulnerabilities in the built environment and reduce the impacts of climate change.</li>
	<li><strong>Build climate smart. </strong>Planners should build with resilience in mind by considering projected climate changes and <a href="/smartgrowth/smart-growth-tools#Climate">smart growth strategies</a>, as well as <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1039db11-5daa-4be5-94ed-fd91825e2742" href="/homeland-security-waste/guidance-about-planning-natural-disaster-debris">planning for natural disasters</a> in advance.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Address inequities.</strong> Cities can take action to reduce climate impacts on all citizens and promote <a href="/environmentaljustice">environmental justice</a>. For example, consider vulnerable populations when planning cooling centers, transportation routes, and green spaces.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Get coordinated.</strong> Climate responses often require coordination among many agencies and sectors. <a href="/arc-x/epa-regional-climate-adaptation-contacts-state-websites">EPA’s regional climate adaptation coordinators</a> can help provide guidance and resources.</li>

<p>Climate change may affect air quality at both local and regional scales. Three key impacts are described in this section.</p>

<h3>1. Outdoor and Indoor Air Pollution</h3>










<figure class="figure  figure--image figure--small   u-align-right"><div class="figure__media">

    <img srcset="/system/files/styles/small/private/images/2022-11/iStock-1049033042.jpg?itok=BtF5uBpO 320w, /system/files/styles/medium/private/images/2022-11/iStock-1049033042.jpg?itok=MvDDiPIC 615w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) calc(100vw - 2rem), 320px" src="/system/files/styles/small/private/images/2022-11/iStock-1049033042.jpg?itok=BtF5uBpO" width="320" height="213" alt="Black mold on white windowsill" loading="lazy"></div>

      <figcaption class="figure__caption">Some people have allergic reactions to mold. These can include sneezing, red eyes, and a skin rash.<a href="#10foot">10</a></figcaption></figure><p>More than 100 million people in the United States live in areas with poor air quality.<sup><a href="#5foot">5</a></sup> In many regions of the United States, climate-driven changes in weather conditions, including temperature and precipitation, are expected to increase ground-level ozone and <a href="/pm-pollution">particulate matter</a> (such as windblown dust from droughts or smoke from wildfires).<sup><a href="#6foot">6</a></sup> These changes worsen existing air pollution. Exposure to these pollutants can lead to or worsen health problems, such as respiratory and heart diseases.</p>

<p>Climate change can also affect indoor air quality. Increases in outside air pollutants, such as ozone and particulate matter, could lead to higher indoor exposures.<sup><a href="#7foot">7</a></sup> These pollutants can enter a building in many ways, including through open doors and windows and ventilation systems.</p>

<p><a href="/mold">Mold</a>, dust mites, bacteria, and other indoor pollutants may increase as climate change-related precipitation and storms increase. For example, flood damage can create a damp indoor environment, leading to mold growth.<sup><a href="#8foot">8</a></sup> Indoor air pollutants have been linked to heart disease, respiratory diseases such as asthma, and cancer.<sup><a href="#9foot">9</a></sup></p>

<p>Air pollution may also damage crops, plants, and forests.<sup><a href="#11foot">11</a></sup> For example, when plants absorb large amounts of ground-level ozone, they experience reduced photosynthesis, slower growth, and higher sensitivity to diseases.<sup><a href="#12foot">12</a></sup></p>

<h3>2. Wildfire Smoke</h3>










<figure class="figure  figure--image figure--small   u-align-right"><div class="figure__media">

    <img srcset="/system/files/styles/small/private/images/2022-11/iStock-1209781521.jpg?itok=baOwrw09 320w, /system/files/styles/medium/private/images/2022-11/iStock-1209781521.jpg?itok=eEx7deH9 612w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) calc(100vw - 2rem), 320px" src="/system/files/styles/small/private/images/2022-11/iStock-1209781521.jpg?itok=baOwrw09" width="320" height="213" alt="Person in mask in front of wildfire" loading="lazy"></div>

      <figcaption class="figure__caption">Exposure to wildfire smoke increases the risk of respiratory diseases.</figcaption></figure><p>Climate change has already led to more frequent wildfires and a longer wildfire season.<sup><a href="#13foot">13</a></sup> Wildfire smoke pollutes the air, impairing visibility and disrupting outdoor activities. It can also spread hundreds of miles downwind to other regions.</p>

<p>Exposure to wildfire smoke can worsen respiratory illnesses, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and bronchitis. Wildfire smoke exposures have also been linked to premature births.<sup><a href="#14foot">14</a></sup></p>

<h3>3. Airborne Allergens</h3>

<p>A changing climate is expected to cause earlier and longer springs and summers, warmer temperatures, precipitation changes, and higher carbon dioxide concentrations. All of these changes can increase people’s exposure to pollen and other airborne allergens, which in turn can lead to more allergy-related illnesses, such as asthma and hay fever.<sup><a href="#15foot">15</a></sup></p>

For example, good air quality improves Americans’ health and productivity. In 2020 alone, reductions in air pollution prevented more than 230,000 premature deaths, 200,000 heart attacks, 120,000 emergency room visits, and 17 million lost workdays.<sup><a href="#16foot">16</a></sup> Working toward cleaner air also creates jobs, advances technologies, and produces billions of dollars for the United States in revenues and exported goods and services.&nbsp;</p>

























  <h2 id="justice">Environmental Justice and Equity</h2>

<p>Many socially vulnerable groups live in industrial or urban areas with high levels of air pollution.<sup><a href="#17foot">17</a>,<a href="#18foot">18</a></sup>&nbsp;In fact, Black and African Americans individuals are 34% more likely than non-Blacks to live in areas with the highest projected increases in childhood asthma due to climate-related changes in particulate matter.<sup><a href="#19foot">19</a></sup>&nbsp;Some people are also more vulnerable to the health impacts of air pollution because they have chronic medical conditions. For example, certain communities of color, low-income groups, Indigenous populations, and immigrant groups have higher rates of heart disease, asthma, and COPD.<sup><a href="#20foot">20</a>,<a href="#21foot">21</a></sup></p>

<p>Certain populations may also be more vulnerable to air quality impacts because they work outside. For example, farm workers, firefighters, roofers, and construction workers are among those workers whom scientists expect will be affected by air quality impacts from climate change.<sup><a href="#22foot">22</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both rural and urban low-income populations may live in older buildings that are not well sealed, increasing their exposure to outdoor allergens and pollutants.<sup><a href="#23foot">23</a></sup> Older buildings or buildings in poor condition may also take more damage during extreme weather, such as storms and floods. This can lead to damp indoor environments prone to mold, bacteria, and other indoor air contaminants.<sup><a href="#24foot">24</a></sup></p>

      <figcaption class="figure__caption">In 2020, about one-fifth of the United States’ annual energy generation came from renewable energy (green power) sources.<a href="#26foot">26</a></figcaption></figure><p>We can reduce climate and air quality impacts in many ways, including the following:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Go green.</strong> Switch to <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/products/green_power_options" data-once="external-links protected-links">green power</a> from renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydropower to reduce both air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Reduce air pollution from vehicles.</strong> Walking, biking, and taking public transit among other actions can <a href="/transportation-air-pollution-and-climate-change/what-you-can-do-reduce-pollution-vehicles-and">reduce emissions from transportation</a>. These choices can also provide other benefits, such as safer streets.</li>
	<li><strong>Improve air quality at ports.</strong> Communities situated near ports—which often include low-income and minority populations—are at a higher risk of air pollution exposure. Communities and stakeholders can work with EPA’s <a href="/ports-initiative">Ports Initiative</a> to improve environmental performance and advance clean technologies at ports. This effort helps people living near ports breathe cleaner air. Check out the <em><a href="/community-port-collaboration/community-port-collaboration-toolkit">Community-Port Collaboration Toolkit</a></em> for ways communities can get involved.</li>
	<li><strong>Develop urban forests. </strong>Planting trees, especially in urban areas and along roads or highways, can help improve air quality. Trees also provide other benefits, such as reducing the impact of <a href="/heatislands/using-trees-and-vegetation-reduce-heat-islands">urban heat islands</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Prevent wildfires. </strong>Pay attention to weather and drought conditions. Avoid activities involving fire or sparks when it’s dry, hot, and windy to help <a href="https://www.doi.gov/blog/10-tips-prevent-wildfires" data-once="external-links protected-links">prevent wildfires<svg class="icon icon--exit is-spaced-before" role="img"><title>Exit EPA’s website</title><use href="/themes/epa_theme/images/sprite.svg#launch"></use></svg></a>.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Reduce your exposure. </strong>Use the <a href="https://www.airnow.gov/" data-once="external-links protected-links">Air Quality Index (AQI)</a> to guide outdoor activities. When you see that the AQI is unhealthy, take simple steps to reduce your exposure like choosing less intense activities, take more breaks, and reschedule activities to a time when outdoor air quality is better.</li>
	<li><strong>Improve indoor air quality.</strong> Reduce or remove sources of indoor air pollutants whenever possible. For example, consider using <a href="/indoor-air-quality-iaq/air-cleaners-and-air-filters-home">portable air purifiers or high-efficiency filters</a> in your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems.</li>

  <h2 id="topc">Top Climate Impacts on Agriculture</h2>

<p>Climate change may affect agriculture at both local and regional scales. Key impacts are described in this section.</p>

<h3>1. Changes in Agricultural Productivity&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Climate change can make conditions better or worse for growing crops in different regions. For example, changes in temperature, rainfall, and frost-free days are leading to longer growing seasons in almost every state.<sup><a href="#8foot">8</a></sup> &nbsp;A longer growing season can have both positive and negative impacts for raising food. Some farmers may be able to plant longer-maturing crops or more crop cycles altogether, while others may need to provide more irrigation over a longer, hotter growing season. Air pollution may also damage crops, plants, and forests.<sup><a href="#9foot">9</a></sup> &nbsp;For example, when plants absorb large amounts of ground-level ozone, they experience reduced photosynthesis, slower growth, and higher sensitivity to diseases.<sup><a href="#10foot">10</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>

<p>Climate change can also increase the threat of <a href="/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-wildfires">wildfires</a>. Wildfires pose major risks to farmlands, grasslands, and rangelands.<sup><a href="#11foot">11</a></sup>&nbsp;Temperature and precipitation changes will also very likely expand the occurrence and range of insects, weeds, and diseases.<sup><a href="#12foot">12</a></sup> &nbsp;This could lead to a greater need for weed and pest control.<sup><a href="#13foot">13</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pollination is vital to more than 100 crops grown in the United States.<sup><a href="#14foot">14</a></sup> &nbsp;Warmer temperatures and changing precipitation can affect when plants bloom and when <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/wildflowers/pollinators/index.shtml" data-once="external-links protected-links">pollinators<svg class="icon icon--exit is-spaced-before" role="img"><title>Exit EPA’s website</title><use href="/themes/epa_theme/images/sprite.svg#launch"></use></svg></a>, such as bees and butterflies, come out.<sup><a href="#15foot">15</a></sup> &nbsp;If mismatches occur between when plants flower and when pollinators emerge, pollination could decrease.<sup><a href="#16foot">16</a></sup></p>

<h3>2. Impacts to Soil and Water Resources</h3>

    <img srcset="/system/files/styles/small/private/images/2022-10/agriculture2.jpg?itok=hmv21BM_ 320w, /system/files/styles/medium/private/images/2022-10/agriculture2.jpg?itok=-eVS-X3k 537w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) calc(100vw - 2rem), 320px" src="/system/files/styles/small/private/images/2022-10/agriculture2.jpg?itok=hmv21BM_" width="320" height="213" alt="Oyster" loading="lazy"></div>

      <figcaption class="figure__caption">Oysters and other animals with limited mobility are vulnerable to hypoxia because they can’t move to other areas.<a href="#17foot">17</a>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Climate change is expected to increase the frequency of <a href="/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-heavy-precipitation">heavy precipitation</a> in the United States, which can harm crops by eroding soil and depleting soil nutrients.<sup><a href="#18foot">18</a></sup> &nbsp;Heavy rains can also increase agricultural <a href="/nps/nonpoint-source-agriculture">runoff</a> into oceans, lakes, and streams.<sup><a href="#19foot">19</a></sup> &nbsp;This runoff can harm water quality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When coupled with warming water temperatures brought on by climate change, runoff can lead to depleted oxygen levels in water bodies. This is known as <a href="/ms-htf/hypoxia-101">hypoxia</a>. Hypoxia can kill fish and shellfish. It can also affect their ability to find food and habitat, which in turn could harm the coastal societies and economies that depend on those ecosystems.<sup><a href="#20foot">20</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sea level rise and storms also pose threats to coastal agricultural communities. These threats include erosion, agricultural land losses, and saltwater intrusion, which can contaminate water supplies.<sup><a href="#21foot">21</a></sup> &nbsp;Climate change is expected to worsen these threats.<sup><a href="#22foot">22</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>3. Health Challenges to Agricultural Workers and Livestock</h3>

<p>Agricultural workers face several climate-related health risks. These include exposures to heat and other extreme weather, more pesticide exposure due to expanded pest presence, disease-carrying pests like mosquitos and ticks, and degraded air quality.<sup><a href="#23foot">23</a></sup> &nbsp;Language barriers, lack of health care access, and other factors can compound these risks.<sup><a href="#24foot">24</a></sup> &nbsp;Heat and humidity can also affect the health and productivity of animals raised for meat, milk, and eggs.<sup><a href="#25foot">25</a></sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Climate change can also affect food security for some Indigenous peoples in Hawai'i and other U.S.-affiliated Pacific islands. Climate impacts like sea level rise and more intense storms can affect the production of crops like taro, breadfruit, and mango.<sup><a href="#36foot">36</a></sup> These crops are often key sources of nutrition and may also have cultural and economic importance.</p>

It affects the physical environment as well as all aspects of both natural and human systems – including social and economic conditions and the functioning of health systems. It is therefore a threat multiplier, undermining and potentially reversing decades of health progress. As climatic conditions change, more frequent and intensifying weather and climate events are observed, including storms, extreme heat, floods, droughts and wildfires. These weather and climate hazards affect health both directly and indirectly, increasing the risk of deaths, noncommunicable diseases, the emergence and spread of infectious diseases, and health emergencies. </p><p>Climate change is also having an impact on our health workforce and infrastructure, reducing capacity to provide universal health coverage (UHC). More fundamentally, climate shocks and growing stresses such as changing temperature and precipitation patterns, drought, floods and rising sea levels degrade the environmental and social determinants of physical and mental health. All aspects of health are affected by climate change, from clean air, water and soil to food systems and livelihoods. Further delay in tackling climate change will increase health risks, undermine decades of improvements in global health, and contravene our collective commitments to ensure the human right to health for all.</p><h2>Climate change impacts on health</h2><h2></h2><p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) concluded that climate risks are appearing faster and will become more severe sooner than previously expected, and it will be harder to adapt with increased global heating.</p><p>It further reveals that 3.6&nbsp;billion people already live in areas highly susceptible to climate change. Despite contributing minimally to global emissions, low-income countries and small island developing states (SIDS) endure the harshest health impacts. In vulnerable regions, the death rate from extreme weather events in the last decade was 15 times higher than in less vulnerable ones.</p><p>Climate change is impacting health in a myriad of ways, including by leading to death and illness from increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms and floods, the disruption of food systems, increases in zoonoses and food-, water- and vector-borne diseases, and mental health issues. Furthermore, climate change is undermining many of the social determinants for good health, such as livelihoods, equality and access to health care and social support structures. These climate-sensitive health risks are disproportionately felt by the most vulnerable and disadvantaged, including women, children, ethnic minorities, poor communities, migrants or displaced persons, older populations, and those with underlying health conditions.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/health-and-climate-change/risk-pathways-climate-health.jpg?sfvrsn=3ba050b0_6" alt="Climate change risk pathways infographic" sf-size="644534"></p><p align="center"><em>Figure:&nbsp;An overview of climate-sensitive health risks, their exposure pathways and vulnerability factors. Climate change impacts health both directly and indirectly, and is strongly mediated by environmental, social and public health determinants.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Although it is unequivocal that climate change affects human health, it remains challenging to accurately estimate the scale and impact of many climate-sensitive health risks. However, scientific advances progressively allow us to attribute an increase in morbidity and mortality to global warming, and more accurately determine the risks and scale of these health threats.</p><p>WHO data indicates 2&nbsp;billion people lack safe drinking water and 600&nbsp;million suffer from foodborne illnesses annually, with children under 5 bearing 30% of foodborne fatalities. Climate stressors heighten waterborne and foodborne disease risks. In 2020, 770&nbsp;million faced hunger, predominantly in Africa and Asia. Climate change affects food availability, quality and diversity, exacerbating food and nutrition crises.</p><p>Temperature and precipitation changes enhance the spread of vector-borne diseases. Without preventive actions, deaths from such diseases, currently over 700 000 annually, may rise. Climate change induces both immediate mental health issues, like anxiety and post-traumatic stress, and long-term disorders due to factors like displacement and disrupted social cohesion.</p><p>Recent research attributes 37% of heat-related deaths to human-induced climate change. Heat-related deaths among those over 65 have risen by 70% in two decades. In 2020, 98&nbsp;million more experienced food insecurity compared to the 1981–2010 average. The WHO conservatively projects 250&nbsp;000 additional yearly deaths by the 2030s due to climate change impacts on diseases like malaria and coastal flooding. However, modelling challenges persist, especially around capturing risks like drought and migration pressures.</p><p>The climate crisis threatens to undo the last 50 years of progress in development, global health and poverty reduction, and to further widen existing health inequalities between and within populations. It severely jeopardizes the realization of UHC in various ways, including by compounding the existing burden of disease and by exacerbating existing barriers to accessing health services, often at the times when they are most needed. Over 930&nbsp;million people – around 12% of the world’s population – spend at least 10% of their household budget to pay for health care. With the poorest people largely uninsured, health shocks and stresses already currently push around 100 million people into poverty every&nbsp;year, with the impacts of climate change worsening this trend.</p><h2>Climate change and equity</h2><p>In the short- to medium-term, the health impacts of climate change will be determined mainly by the vulnerability of populations, their resilience to the current rate of climate change and the extent and pace of adaptation. In the longer-term, the effects will increasingly depend on the extent to which transformational action is taken now to reduce emissions and avoid the breaching of dangerous temperature thresholds and potential irreversible tipping points.</p><p>While no one is safe from these risks, the people whose health is being harmed first and worst by the climate crisis are the people who contribute least to its causes, and who are least able to protect themselves and their families against it: people in low-income and disadvantaged countries and communities.</p><p>Addressing climate change's health burden underscores the equity imperative: those most responsible for emissions should bear the highest mitigation and adaptation costs, emphasizing health equity and vulnerable group prioritization.</p><h2>Need for urgent action</h2><p>To avert catastrophic health impacts and prevent millions of climate change-related deaths, the world must limit temperature rise to 1.5°C. Past emissions have already made a certain level of global temperature rise and other changes to the climate inevitable. Global heating of even 1.5°C is not considered safe, however; every additional tenth of a degree of warming will take a serious toll on people’s lives and health.</p><h2>WHO response</h2><p>WHO’s response to these challenges centres around 3 main objectives:</p><ul><li><strong>Promote actions that both reduce carbon emissions and improve health: </strong>supporting a rapid and equitable transition to a clean energy economy; ensuring that health is central to climate change mitigation policy; accelerating mitigation actions that bring the greatest health gains; and mobilizing the strength of the health community to drive policy change and build public support.</li><li><strong>Build better, more climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable health systems: </strong>ensuring core services, environmental sustainability and climate resilience as central components of UHC and primary health care (PHC); supporting health systems to leapfrog to cheaper, more reliable and cleaner solutions, while decarbonizing high-emitting health systems; and mainstreaming climate resilience and environmental sustainability into health service investments, including the capacity of the health workforce. </li><li><strong>Protect health from the wide range of impacts of climate change</strong>: assessing health vulnerabilities and developing health plans; integrating climate risk and implementing climate-informed surveillance and response systems for key risks, such as extreme heat and infectious disease; supporting resilience and adaptation in health-determining sectors such as water and food; and closing the financing gap for health adaptation and resilience.<strong style="background-color:transparent;font-size:16px;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;">&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Leadership and Raising Awareness</strong>: WHO leads in emphasizing climate change's health implications, aiming to centralize health in climate policies, including through the UNFCCC. Partnering with major health agencies, health professionals and civil society, WHO strives to embed climate change in health priorities like UHC and target carbon neutrality by 2030.</p><p><strong>Evidence and Monitoring</strong>: WHO, with its network of global experts, contributes global evidence summaries, provides assistance to nations in their assessments, and monitors progress. The emphasis is on deploying effective policies and enhancing access to knowledge and data.</p><p><strong>Capacity Building and Country Support</strong>: Through WHO offices, support is given to ministries of health, focusing on collaboration across sectors, updated guidance, hands-on training, and support for project preparation and execution as well as for securing climate and health funding.&nbsp; WHO leads the <a href="/initiatives/alliance-for-transformative-action-on-climate-and-health">Alliance for Transformative Action on Climate and Health (ATACH)</a>, bringing together a range of health and development partners, to support countries in achieving their commitments to climate-resilient and low carbon health systems.</p></div>

  </figure><p>"Weather" refers to the day-to-day state of the atmosphere such as the combination of temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind, and other factors. "Climate" describes the weather of a place averaged over a period of time, often 30 years. Think about it this way: climate is something that can be expected to happen in general, like a cold winter season, whereas weather is what a person might experience on any given day, like a snowstorm in January or a sunny day in July.</p>

  </figure><p>Climate change involves significant changes in average conditions—such as temperature, precipitation, wind patterns, and other aspects of climate—that occur over years, decades, centuries, or longer. Climate change involves longer-term trends, such as shifts toward warmer, wetter, or drier conditions. These trends can be caused by&nbsp;natural variability in climate over time, as well as <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7661b998-a7b9-4f5c-8247-8d948176f3c1" href="/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions">human activities</a> that add <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0b14ad27-4218-4f4f-afa6-37393931da49" href="/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases">greenhouse gases</a> to the atmosphere like burning fossil fuels for energy.</p>

<hr><h3 id="global-warming-climate-change">What is the difference between global warming and climate change?</h3>

<p>The terms "global warming" and "climate change" are sometimes used interchangeably, but global warming is just one of the ways in which climate is affected by rising concentrations of greenhouse gases. "Global warming" describes the recent <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3edabb43-ece6-4f57-8258-3d16aa501507" href="/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-us-and-global-temperature">rise in the global average temperature</a> near the earth's surface, which is caused mostly by <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="404416dd-23ca-467f-8165-890dc6701c44" href="/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-atmospheric-concentrations-greenhouse-gases">increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases</a> (such as carbon dioxide and methane) in the atmosphere from <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7661b998-a7b9-4f5c-8247-8d948176f3c1" href="/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions">human activities</a> such as burning fossil fuels for energy.</p>

<hr><h3 id="climate-change-variability">What is the difference between climate change and climate variability?</h3>

<p>Climate change occurs over a long period of time, typically over decades or longer. In contrast, climate variability includes changes that occur within shorter timeframes, such as a month, season, or year. Climate variability explains the natural variability within the system. For example, one unusually cold or wet year followed by an unusually warm or dry year would not be considered a sign of climate change.</p>

  </figure><p>Even though the planet is warming, some areas may be experiencing extra cold or snowy winters. These cold spells are due to variability in local weather patterns, which sometimes lead to colder-than-average seasons or even colder-than-average years at the local or regional level. In fact, a warmer climate traps more water vapor in the air, which may lead to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0a2aa022-da47-4460-9d36-afa49b8ea4b3" href="/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-snowfall">extra snowy winters</a> in some areas. As long as it is still cold enough to snow, a warming climate can lead to bigger snowstorms.</p>

<hr><h3 id="scientific-consensus">Is there scientific consensus that people are causing today’s climate change?</h3>

<p>Yes. Climate scientists overwhelmingly agree that people are contributing significantly to today’s climate change, primarily by releasing excess greenhouse gases into the atmosphere from activities such as burning fossil fuels for energy, cultivating crops, raising livestock, and clearing forests. The<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/" data-once="external-links protected-links"> Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Sixth Assessment Report<svg class="icon icon--exit is-spaced-before" role="img"><title>Exit EPA’s website</title><use href="/themes/epa_theme/images/sprite.svg#launch"></use></svg></a>, which represents the work of hundreds of leading experts in climate science, <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM_final.pdf" data-once="external-links protected-links">states<svg class="icon icon--exit is-spaced-before" role="img"><title>Exit EPA’s website</title><use href="/themes/epa_theme/images/sprite.svg#launch"></use></svg></a> that "it is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land.

<hr><h3 id="risk">Who is most at risk from the impacts of climate change?</h3>

<p>Everyone will be affected by climate change, but some people may be more affected than others. Among the most vulnerable people are those in overburdened, underserved, and economically distressed communities. Three key factors influence a person’s vulnerability to the impacts of climate change:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Exposure</strong>. Some people are more at risk simply because they are more exposed to climate change hazards where they live or work. For example, people who live on the coast can be more vulnerable to sea level rise, coastal storms, and flooding.</li>
	<li><strong>Sensitivity</strong>. Some people are more sensitive to the impacts of climate change, such as children, pregnant women, and those with pre-existing medical conditions such as asthma.</li>
	<li><strong>Adaptability</strong>. Older adults, those with disabilities, those with low income, and some indigenous people may have more difficulty than others in adapting to climate change hazards.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, there is a wide range of other factors that influence people’s vulnerability. For example, people with less access to healthcare, adequate housing, and financial resources are less likely to rebound from climate disasters. People who are excluded from planning processes, experience racial and ethnic discrimination, or have language barriers are also more vulnerable to and less able to prepare for and avoid the risks of climate change.</p>

<hr><h2>Solutions</h2>

<h3 id="reduce-risks">How can people reduce the risks of climate change?</h3>

<p>People can reduce the risks of climate change by <a href="/climate-change/what-you-can-do-about-climate-change">making choices</a> that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and by preparing for the changes expected in the future. Decisions that people make today will shape the world for decades and even centuries to come. Communities can also prepare for the changes in the decades ahead by identifying and reducing their vulnerabilities and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7810c390-c5dc-4e64-a800-8f810118abbc" href="/climate-adaptation">considering climate change risks in planning and development</a>.

<p>Activities such as agriculture, road construction, and deforestation can change the reflectivity of the earth's surface, leading to local warming or cooling. This effect is observed in <a href="/heatislands">heat islands</a>, which are urban centers that are warmer than the surrounding, less populated areas. One reason that these areas are warmer is that buildings, pavement, and roofs tend to reflect less sunlight than natural surfaces. While deforestation can increase the earth’s reflectivity globally by replacing dark trees with lighter surfaces such as crops, the net effect of all land-use changes appears to be a small cooling.<a href="#13foot"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>Emissions of small particles, known as aerosols, into the air can also lead to reflection or absorption of the sun's energy. Many types of air pollutants undergo chemical reactions in the atmosphere to create aerosols. Overall, human-generated aerosols have a net cooling effect on the earth. Learn more about human-generated and natural <a href="/climatechange-science/basics-climate-change#aerosols">aerosols</a>.</p>

<hr><h2 id="natural">Natural Processes</h2>

<p>Natural processes are always influencing the earth’s climate and can explain climate changes prior to the Industrial Revolution in the 1700s. However, recent climate changes cannot be explained by natural causes alone.</p>

<h3 id="rotation">Changes in the Earth’s Orbit and Rotation</h3>

<p>Changes in the earth’s orbit and its axis of rotation have had a big impact on climate in the past. For example, the amount of summer sunshine on the Northern Hemisphere, which is affected by changes in the planet’s orbit, appears to be the primary cause of past cycles of ice ages, in which the earth has experienced long periods of cold temperatures (ice ages), as well as shorter interglacial periods (periods between ice ages) of relatively warmer temperatures.<a href="#14foot"><sup>14</sup></a>&nbsp; At the coldest part of the last glacial period (or ice age), the average global temperature was about 11°F&nbsp;colder than it is&nbsp;today. At the peak of the last interglacial period, however, the average global temperature was&nbsp;at most 2°F&nbsp;warmer than it is today.<a href="#15foot"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="solaractivity">Variations in Solar Activity</h3>

<p>Changes in the sun’s energy output can affect the intensity of the sunlight that reaches the earth’s surface. While these changes can influence the earth’s climate, solar variations have played little role in the climate changes observed in recent decades.<a href="#16foot"><sup>16</sup></a> Satellites have been measuring the amount of energy the earth receives from the sun since 1978. These measurements show no net increase in the sun’s output, even as global surface temperatures have risen.<a href="#17foot"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>The amount of sunlight that is absorbed or reflected by the planet depends on the earth’s surface and atmosphere. Dark objects and surfaces, like the ocean, forests, and soil, tend to absorb more sunlight. Light-colored objects and surfaces, like snow and clouds, tend to reflect sunlight. About 70 percent of the sunlight that reaches the earth is absorbed.<a href="#18foot"><sup>18</sup></a> Natural changes in the earth’s surface, like the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="91818516-f68f-4a80-a3e0-35488c97b63a" href="/climate-indicators/snow-ice">melting of sea ice</a>, have contributed to climate change in the past, often acting as <a href="/climatechange-science/basics-climate-change#feedbacks">feedbacks</a>&nbsp;to other processes.</p>

<h3 id="volcanic">Volcanic Activity</h3>

<p>Volcanoes have played a noticeable role in climate, and volcanic eruptions released large quantities of carbon dioxide in the distant past. Some explosive volcano eruptions can throw particles (e.g., SO<sub>2</sub>)&nbsp;into the upper atmosphere, where they can reflect enough sunlight back to space to cool the surface of the planet for several years.<a href="#19foot"><sup>19</sup></a> These particles are an example of cooling <a href="/climatechange-science/basics-climate-change#aerosols">aerosols</a>.</p>

<p>Volcanic particles from a single eruption do not produce long-term climate change because they remain in the atmosphere for a much shorter time than greenhouse gases. In addition, human activities emit more than 100 times as much carbon dioxide as volcanoes each year.<a href="#20foot"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="carbondioxide">Changes in Naturally Occurring Carbon Dioxide Concentrations</h3>

<p>Over the last several hundred thousand years, carbon dioxide levels varied in tandem with the glacial cycles. During warm interglacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were higher. During cool glacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were lower.<a href="#21foot"><sup>21</sup></a> The heating or cooling of the earth’s surface and oceans can cause changes in the natural sources and sinks of these gases, and thus change greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.<a href="#22foot"><sup>22</sup></a> These changing concentrations have acted as a positive <a href="/climatechange-science/basics-climate-change#feedbacks">climate feedback</a>, amplifying the temperature changes caused by long-term shifts in the earth’s orbit.<a href="#23foot"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

  <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>Elevated concentrations of carbon dioxide will persist in the atmosphere for hundreds or thousands of years, so the earth will continue to warm in the coming decades. The warmer it gets, the greater the risk for more severe changes to the climate and the earth's system. Although it's difficult to predict the exact impacts of climate change, what's clear is that the climate we are accustomed to is no longer a reliable guide for what to expect in the future.</p>

      <figcaption class="figure__caption"><em>The greenhouse effect helps trap heat from the sun, which keeps the temperature on earth comfortable. But people’s activities are increasing the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, causing the earth to warm up.</em></figcaption></figure><p>The earth's temperature depends on the balance between energy entering and leaving the planet’s system. When sunlight reaches the earth’s surface, it can either be reflected back into space or absorbed by the earth. Incoming energy that is absorbed by the earth warms the planet. Once absorbed, the planet releases some of the energy back into the atmosphere as heat (also called infrared radiation). Solar energy that is reflected back to space does not warm the earth.</p>

<p>Certain gases in the atmosphere absorb energy, slowing or preventing the loss of heat to space. Those gases are known as “greenhouse gases.” They act like a blanket, making the earth warmer than it would otherwise be. This process, commonly known as the “greenhouse effect,” is natural and necessary to support life. However, the recent buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from human activities has changed the earth's climate and resulted in dangerous effects to human health and welfare and to ecosystems.</p>

<h3>Carbon Dioxide</h3>

<p>Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas contributing to recent climate change. Carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere through burning fossil fuels, solid waste, trees, and other biological materials, and as a result of certain chemical reactions, such as cement manufacturing. Carbon dioxide is absorbed and emitted naturally as part of the carbon cycle, through plant and animal respiration, volcanic eruptions, and ocean-atmosphere exchange.</p>

<div class="box box--related-info">
<div class="box__title">The Carbon Cycle</div>

<div class="box__content">
<p>The carbon cycle is the process by which carbon continually moves from the atmosphere to the earth and then back to the atmosphere. On the earth, carbon is stored in rocks, sediments, the ocean, and in living organisms. Carbon is released back into the atmosphere when plants and animals die, as well as when fires burn, volcanoes erupt, and fossil fuels (such as coal, natural gas, and oil) are combusted. The carbon cycle ensures there is a balanced concentration of carbon in the different reservoirs on the planet. But a change in the amount of carbon in one reservoir affects all the others. Today, people are disturbing the carbon cycle by burning fossil fuels, which release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and through land use changes that remove plants, which absorb carbon from the atmosphere.</p>

<h3>Methane</h3>

<p>Both natural and human activities produce methane. For example, natural wetlands, agricultural activities, and fossil fuel extraction and transport all emit methane.</p>

<h3>Nitrous Oxide</h3>

<p>Nitrous oxide is produced mainly through agricultural activities and natural biological processes. Fossil fuel burning and industrial processes also create nitrous oxide.</p>

<h3>F-Gases</h3>

<p>Chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride, together called <a href="/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#f-gases">F-gases</a>, are often used in coolants, foaming agents, fire extinguishers, solvents, pesticides, and aerosol propellants.</p>

<hr><div class="box box--related-info u-align-right">
<div class="box__title">Global Warming Potential</div>

<div class="box__content">
<p>Different greenhouse gases can remain in the atmosphere for different amounts of time, ranging from a few years to thousands of years. In addition, some gases are more effective than others at making the planet warmer. Learn more about <a href="/ghgemissions/understanding-global-warming-potentials">Global Warming Potential (GWP)</a>, a measure of climate impacts based on how long each greenhouse gas remains in the atmosphere and how strongly it absorbs energy.</p>

<h2 id="othergases">Other Greenhouse Gases</h2>

<h3>Ground-Level Ozone</h3>

<p><a href="/ground-level-ozone-pollution">Ground-level ozone</a> is created by a chemical reaction between emissions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds from automobiles, power plants, and other industrial and commercial sources in the presence of sunlight. In addition to trapping heat, ground-level ozone is a pollutant that can cause respiratory health problems and damage crops and ecosystems.</p>

<h3>Water Vapor</h3>

<p>Water vapor is another greenhouse gas and plays a key role in <a href="#feedbacks">climate feedbacks</a> because of its heat-trapping ability. Warmer air holds more moisture than cooler air. Therefore, as greenhouse gas concentrations increase and global temperatures rise, the total amount of water vapor in the atmosphere also increases, further amplifying the warming effect.<a href="#5foot"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

  </figure><p>Aerosols in the atmosphere can affect climate. Aerosols are microscopic (solid or liquid) particles that are so small that instead of quickly falling to the surface like larger particles, they remain suspended in the air for days to weeks. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and biomass, contribute to emissions of these substances, although some aerosols also come from natural sources such as volcanoes and marine plankton.</p>

<p>Unlike greenhouse gases, the climate effects of aerosols vary depending on what they are made of and where they are emitted. Depending on their color and other factors, aerosols can either absorb or reflect sunlight. Aerosols that reflect sunlight, such as particles from volcanic eruptions or sulfur emissions from burning coal, have a cooling effect. Those that absorb sunlight, such as <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/airquality/blackcarbon/" data-once="external-links protected-links">black carbon</a> (a part of soot), have a warming effect.</p>

<p>Not only can black carbon directly absorb incoming and reflected sunlight, but it can also absorb infrared radiation.<a href="#6foot"><sup>6</sup></a> Black carbon can also be deposited on snow and ice, darkening the surface and thereby increasing the snow's absorption of sunlight and accelerating melt.<a href="#7foot"><sup>7</sup></a> While reductions in all aerosols can lead to more warming, targeted reductions in black carbon emissions can reduce global warming. Warming and cooling aerosols can also interact with clouds, changing their ability to form and dissipate, as well as their reflectivity and precipitation rates. Clouds can contribute both to cooling, by reflecting sunlight, and warming, by trapping outgoing heat.</p>

  <hr><h2 id="feedbacks">Climate Feedbacks</h2>

<p>Climate feedbacks are natural processes that respond to global warming by offsetting or further increasing change in the climate system. Feedbacks that offset the change in climate are called negative feedbacks. Feedbacks that amplify changes are called positive feedbacks.</p>

<p>Climate change can lead to changes in the coverage, altitude, and reflectivity of clouds. These changes can then either amplify (positive feedback) or dampen (negative feedback) the original change. The net effect of these changes is likely an amplifying, or positive, feedback due mainly to increasing altitude of high clouds in the tropics, which makes them better able to trap heat, and reductions in coverage of lower-level clouds in the mid-latitudes, which reduces the amount of sunlight they reflect. The magnitude of this feedback is uncertain due to the complex nature of cloud/climate interactions.<a href="#8foot"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
